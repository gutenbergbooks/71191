<p class="first">This Book was juſt finiſhed, and deſigned for the Preſs, when the Author, to the great
loſs of the Learned World, was ſeized by a Diſeaſe that brought him to his Death.
However he took care in his laſt Will of its Publication, deſiring his Brother, to
whom it was writ, to take that Trouble upon him. But he was ſo taken up with Buſineſs
and Removals, (as being Secretary in <i>Holland</i> to the King of <i>Great Britain</i>) that he could find no time for it till a Year after the Death of the Author: When
it ſo fell out, that the Printers being ſomewhat tardy, and this Gentleman dying,
the Book was left without either Father or Guardian. Yet it <span class="pageNum" id="pb.iv">[<a href="#pb.iv">iv</a>]</span>now ventures into the Publick, in the ſame Method that it was writ by the Author,
and with the ſame Inſcription to his Brother, tho’ dead; in confidence that this laſt
Piece of his will meet with as kind a Reception from the World as all the other Works
of that Author have. ’Tis true there are not every where Mathematical Demonſtrations;
but where they are wanting, you have probable and ingenious Conjectures, which is
the moſt that can be reaſonably expected in ſuch matters. What belongs to, or has
any thing to do with Aſtronomy, you will ſee demonſtrated, and the reſt ingeniouſly
and ſhrewdly gueſs’d at, from the Affinity and Relation of the heavenly Bodies to
the Earth. For your farther Satisfaction read on, and farewel.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A Man that is of <i>Copernicus</i>’s Opinion, that this Earth of ours is a Planet, carry’d round and enlighten’d by
the Sun, like the reſt of the Planets, cannot but ſometimes think, that it’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>not improbable that the reſt of the Planets have their Dreſs and Furniture, and perhaps
their Inhabitants too as well as this Earth of ours: Eſpecially if he conſiders the
later Diſcoveries made in the Heavens ſince <i>Copernicus</i>’s time, <i>viz.</i> the Attendants of <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i>, and the champaign and hilly Countries in the Moon, which are a ſtrong Argument of
a Relation and Kin between our Earth and them, as well as a Proof of the Truth of
that Syſtem. This has often been our Talk, I remember, good Brother, over a large
Teleſcope, when we have been viewing thoſe Bodies, a Study that your continual Buſineſs
and Abſence have interrupted for many Years. But we were always apt to conclude, that
’twas in vain to enquire after what Nature is doing there, ſeeing there was no likelihood
of ever coming to any Certainty of the Enquiry. Nor could I ever find that any Philoſophers,
either antient or modern, have attempted any thing upon this Subject. At the very
Birth <span class="pageNum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>of Aſtronomy, when the Earth was firſt aſſerted to be Spherical, and to <span class="marginnote"><i>Some have already talk’d of the Inhabitants of the Planets, but went no farther.</i></span> be ſurrounded with Air, even then there were ſome Men ſo bold as to affirm, there
were an innumerable Company of Worlds in the Stars. But later Authors, ſuch as Cardinal
<i>Cuſanus</i>, <i>Brunus</i>, <i>Kepler</i>, (and if we may believe him, <i>Tycho</i> was of that opinion too) have furniſhed the Planets with Inhabitants. Nay, <i>Cuſanus</i> and <i>Brunus</i> have allowed the Sun and fixed Stars theirs too. But this was the utmoſt of their
Boldneſs; nor has the ingenious <i>French</i> Author of the Dialogues about <i>the Plurality of Worlds</i> carried this Matter any farther. Only ſome of them have coined ſome Stories of the
Men in the Moon, juſt as probable as <i>Lucian</i>’s true Hiſtory; among which I muſt count <i>Kepler</i>’s, which he has diverted us with in his Aſtronomical Dream. But a while ago thinking
ſomewhat ſeriouſly of this matter (not that I count my ſelf quicker-ſighted than thoſe
great Men, but that I had the Happineſs to live after <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>moſt of them) the Enquiry appeared not ſo impracticable, nor the Way ſo ſtopt up with
Difficulties, but that there was very good room left for probable Conjectures. As
they came into my Head, I put them down into common Places, and ſhall now try to digeſt
them into ſome Method for your better Conception of them, and add ſomewhat of the
Sun and fix’d Stars, and the Extent of that Univerſe of which our Earth is but an
inconſiderable Point. I know you have ſuch an Eſteem and Reverence for any thing that
belongs to the Heavens, that I perſwade my ſelf you will read what I have written
with ſome Pleaſure: I’m ſure I writ it with a great deal; but as often before, ſo
now, I find the Saying of <i>Archytas</i> true, even to the Letter, <i>That tho’ a Man were admitted into Heaven to view the wonderful Fabrick of the World,
and the Beauty of the Stars, yet what would otherwiſe be Rapture and Extaſie, would
be but a melancholy Amazement if he had not a Friend to communicate <span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>it to</i>. I could wiſh indeed that all the World might not be my Judges, but that I might
chuſe my Readers, Men like you, not ignorant in Aſtronomy and true Philoſophy; for
with ſuch I might promiſe my ſelf a favourable hearing, and not need to make an Apology
for daring to vent any thing new to the World. But becauſe I am aware what weak Hands
it’s likely to fall into, and what a ſevere Sentence I may expect from thoſe whoſe
Ignorance or Zeal is too great; it may be worth the while to guard my ſelf beforehand
againſt the Aſſaults of thoſe ſort of People.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Objections of ignorant Cavillers prevented.</i></span> There’s one ſort who knowing nothing of Geometry or Mathematicks, will laugh at it
as a whimſical and ridiculous Undertaking. It’s an incredible Thing to them to talk
of meaſuring the Diſtance and Magnitude of the Stars: And for the Motion of the Earth,
they count it, if not a falſe, at leaſt a precarious Opinion; and no wonder then if
they take what’s built upon ſuch a ſlippery Foundation <span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>for the Dreams of a fanciful Head and a diſtemper’d Brain. What ſhould we anſwer to
theſe Men, but that their Ignorance is the Cauſe of their Diſlike, and that if they
had ſtudied theſe things more, and viewed the Works of Nature nicely, they would have
fewer Scruples? But few People having had an opportunity of proſecuting theſe Studies,
either for want of Parts, Learning or Leiſure, we cannot blame their Ignorance; and
if they reſolve to find fault with us for ſpending time in ſuch Matters, becauſe they
do not underſtand the Uſe of them, we muſt appeal to properer Judges.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Theſe Conjectures do not contradict the holy Scriptures.</i></span> The other ſort, When they hear us talk of new Lands, and Animals, and Creatures endued
with as much Reaſon as themſelves, will be ready to cry out, that we ſet up our Conjectures
againſt the Word of God, and broach Opinions directly oppoſite to Holy Writ. For we
do not there read any thing of the Production of ſuch Creatures, no not ſo much as
that they exiſt; nay rather we <span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>read the quite contrary. For, That only mentions this Earth with its Animals and Plants,
and Man the Lord of them: To ſuch Perſons I anſwer, what has been often urged by others
before me: That it’s evident, God had no deſign to make a particular Enumeration in
the Holy Scriptures, of all the Works of his Creation. When therefore it is plain
that under the general Name of <i>Stars</i> or <i>Earth</i> at the Creation, are comprehended all the Heavenly Bodies, even the Attendants upon
<i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i>, why muſt all that Multitude of Beings which the Almighty Creator has been pleaſed
to place upon them, be excluded the Privilege, and not ſuffered to have a Share in
the Expreſſion? And theſe Men themſelves can’t but know in what Senſe it is that all
things are ſaid to be made for the Uſe of Man, not certainly for us to look at through
a Teleſcope, for that’s very abſurd. Since then the greateſt part of God’s Creation,
that innumerable multitude of Stars, is placed out of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>reach of any Man’s Eye; and many of them it’s likely, of the beſt Glaſſes, ſo that
they don’t ſeem to belong to us; is it ſuch an unreaſonable Opinion to think, that
there are ſome reaſonable Creatures who ſee and admire thoſe glorious Bodies at a
nearer diſtance?
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>This Enquiry not over curious.</i></span> But perhaps they’ll ſay, it does not become us to be ſo curious and inquiſitive in
theſe Things which the Supreme Creator ſeems to have kept for his own Knowledge: For
ſince he has not been pleaſed to make any farther Diſcovery or Revelation of them,
it ſeems little better than preſumption to make any inquiry into that which he has
thought fit to hide. But theſe Gentlemen muſt be told, that they take too much upon
themſelves when they pretend to appoint how far and no farther Men ſhall go in their
Searches, and to ſet bounds to other Mens Induſtry; as if they knew the Marks that
God has placed to Knowledge: or as if Men were able to paſs thoſe Marks. If our Forefathers
had been at this rate ſcrupulous, we might <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>have been ignorant ſtill of the Magnitude and Figure of the Earth, or that there was
ſuch a Place as <i>America</i>. We ſhould not have known that the Moon is inlightned by the Sun’s Rays, nor what
the Cauſes of the Eclipſes of each of them are, nor a multitude of other Things brought
to light by the late Diſcoveries in Aſtronomy. For what can a Man imagine more abſtruſe,
or leſs likely to be known, than what is now as clear as the Sun? Whence it follows,
that vigorous Induſtry, and piercing Wit were given Men to make Advances in the Search
of Nature, and there’s no Reaſon to put any Stop to ſuch Enquiries. I muſt acknowledge
that what I here intend to treat of is not of that Nature as to admit of a certain
Knowledge; I can’t pretend to aſſert any thing as poſitively true (for how is it poſſible)
but only to advance a probable Gueſs, the Truth of which every one is at his own liberty
to examine. If any one therefore ſhall gravely tell me, that I have ſpent my Time
idly in a vain and fruitleſs Enquiry <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>after what by my own acknowledgment I can never come to be ſure of; The Anſwer is,
that at this rate he would put down all Natural Philoſophy as far as it concerns it
ſelf in ſearching into the Nature <span class="marginnote"><i>Conjectures not uſeleſs, becauſe not certain.</i></span> of Things: In ſuch noble and ſublime Studies as theſe, ’tis a Glory to arrive at
Probability, and the Search it ſelf rewards the Pains. But there are many degrees
of Probable, ſome nearer Truth than others, in the determining of which lies the chief
exerciſe <span class="marginnote"><i>Theſe Studies uſeful to Religion.</i></span> of our Judgment. But beſides the Nobleneſs and Pleaſure of the Studies, may not we
be ſo bold as to ſay, they are no ſmall help to the Advancement of Wiſdom and Morality?
ſo far are they from being of no uſe at all. For here we may mount from this dull
Earth, and viewing it from on high, conſider whether Nature has laid out all her Coſt
and Finery upon this ſmall Speck of Dirt. So, like Travellers into other diſtant Countries,
we ſhall be better able to judge of what’s done at home, know how to make a true Eſtimate
of, and ſet <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>its own Value upon every Thing. We ſhall be leſs apt to admire what this World calls
Great, ſhall nobly deſpiſe thoſe Trifles the generality of Men ſet their Affections
on, when we know that there are a multitude of ſuch Earths inhabited and adorned as
well as our own. And we ſhall worſhip and reverence that God the Maker of all theſe
things; we ſhall admire and adore his Providence and wonderful Wiſdom which is diſplayed
and manifeſted all over the Univerſe, to the Confuſion of thoſe who would have the
Earth and all things formed by the ſhuffling Concourſe of Atoms, or to be without
beginning. But to come to our Purpoſe.

</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Copernicus<i>’s Syſtem explained</i>.</span> And now becauſe the chief Argument for the Proof of what we intend will be taken
from the Diſpoſition of the Planets, among which without doubt, the Earth muſt be
counted in the Copernican Syſtem, I ſhall here firſt of all draw two Figures. The
firſt is a Deſcription of <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>the Orbs the Planets move in, in that order that they are placed round the Sun, drawn
as near as can be in their true Proportions, like what you have ſeen in my Clock at
home. The ſecond ſhows the Proportions of their Magnitudes in reſpect of one another
and of the Sun, which you know is upon that ſame Clock of mine too. In the firſt the
middle Point or Center is the Place of the Sun, round which, in an order that every
one knows, are the Orbits of <i>Mercury</i>, <i>Venus</i>, the Earth with that of the Moon about it; then thoſe of <i>Mars</i>, <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i>: and about the two laſt the ſmall Circles that their Attendants move in: about <i>Jupiter</i> four, and about <i>Saturn</i> five. Which Circles as well as that of the Moon are drawn larger than their true
Proportion would admit, otherwiſe they could not have been ſeen. You may eaſily apprehend
the Vaſtneſs of theſe Orbits by this, that the diſtance of the Earth from the Sun
is ten or twelve thouſand of the Earth’s Diameters. Almoſt all theſe Circles are in
the ſame Plane, declining very <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>little from that in which the Earth moves, call’d <i>The Plane of the Ecliptick</i>. This Plane is cut obliquely by the Axis upon which the Earth turns it ſelf round
with reſpect to the Sun in 24 Hours, whence ariſe the Succeſſions of Day and Night:
The Axis of the Earth always keeping the ſame Inclination to the Ecliptick (except
a ſmall Change beſt known to Aſtronomers) while the Earth itſelf is carried in its
yearly Courſe round the Sun, cauſes the regular Order of the Seaſons of the Year:
as you may ſee in all Aſtronomers Books. Out of which I ſhall tranſcribe hither the
Periods of the Revolutions of the Planets, <i>viz. Saturn</i> moves round the Sun in 29 Years, 174 Days, and 5 Hours: <i>Jupiter</i> finiſhes his Courſe in 11 Years, 317 Days, and 15 Hours: <i>Mars</i> his in about 687 Days. Our Year is 365 Days 6 Hours: <i>Venus</i>’s 224 Days 18 Hours: and <i>Mercury</i>’s 88 Days. This is the now commonly received Syſtem, invented by <i>Copernicus</i>, and very agreeable to that frugal Simplicity Nature ſhows in all <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>Arguments for the Truth on’t.</i></span> her Works. If any one is reſolved to find fault with it, let him firſt be ſure he
underſtands it. Let him firſt ſee in the Books of Aſtronomers with how much greater
Eaſe and Plainneſs all the Motions of the Stars, and Appearances in the Heavens are
explained and demonſtrated in this than either in that of <i>Ptolomy</i> or <i>Tycho</i>. Let him conſider that Diſcovery of <i>Kepler</i>, that the Diſtances of the Planets from the Sun, as well of the Earth as the reſt,
are in a fix’d certain proportion to the Times they ſpend in their Revolutions. Which
Proportion it’s ſince obſerved that their Satellites keep round <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i>. Let him examine what a contradictory Motion they are fain to invent for the Solution
of the Polar Star’s changing its Diſtance from the Pole. For that Star in the end
of the little Bear’s Tail which now deſcribes ſo ſmall a Circle round the Pole, that
it is not above two Degrees and twenty Minutes, was obſerved about 1820 Years ago,
in the Time of <i>Hipparchus</i>, to be above 12: <span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>and will within a few Ages more be 45 Degrees diſtant from it: and after 25000 Years
more will return to the ſame Place it is now in. Now if with them we allow the Heavens
to be turned upon their own Axis, at this rate they muſt have a new Axis every Day:
a Thing moſt abſurd, and repugnant to the Nature of all Motion. Whereas nothing is
eaſier with <i>Copernicus</i> than to give us Satisfaction in this Matter. Then he may impartially weigh thoſe
Anſwers that <i>Galilæus</i>, <i>Gaſſendus</i>, <i>Kepler</i>, and others have given to all Objections propoſed, which have ſo ſatisfied all Scruples,
that generally all Aſtronomers now-a-days are brought over to our Side, and allow
the Earth its Motion and Place among the Planets. If he cannot be ſatisfied with all
this, he is either one whoſe Dulneſs can’t comprehend it, or who has his Belief at
another Man’s Diſpoſal.
</p>
<p></p>

<p class="first">p. 15.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>In the other Figure you have the Globes of the Planets, and of the Sun, repreſented
to your Eyes as placed near one another. Where <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>The Proportion of the Magnitude of the Planets, in reſpect of one another, and the
Sun.</i></span> I have obſerved the ſame Proportion, of their Diameters to that of the Sun, that
I publiſhed to the World in my Book of <i>The Appearances of Saturn</i>: namely, the Diameter of the Ring round <i>Saturn</i> is to that of the Sun as 11 as to 37; that of <i>Saturn</i> himſelf about as 5 to 37; that of <i>Jupiter</i> as 2 to 11; that of <i>Mars</i> as 1 to 166; of the Earth as 1 to 111; and of <i>Venus</i> as 1 to 84: to which I ſhall now add that of <i>Mercury</i> obſerved by <i>Hevelius</i> in the Year 1661, but calculated by my ſelf, and found to be as 1 to 290.
</p>
<p>If you would know the way that we came to this Knowledge of their Magnitudes, by knowing
the Proportion of their Diſtances from the Sun, and the Meaſures of their Diameters,
you may find it in the Book before-mentioned: And I cannot yet ſee any Reaſon to make
an Alteration in thoſe I then ſettled, altho’ I will not ſay they are without their
Faults. <span class="marginnote"><i>The</i> Lamellæ <i>more convenient than Micrometers.</i></span> For I can’t yet be of their Mind, who think the Uſe of Micrometers, as they call
them, is beyond that of <span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>our Plates, but muſt ſtill think that thoſe thin Plates or Rods of which I there taught
the Uſe, not to detract from the due Praiſes of ſo uſeful an Invention, are more convenient
than the Micrometers.
</p>
<p>In this proportion of the Planets it is worth while to take notice of the prodigious
Magnitude of the Sun in compariſon with the four innermoſt, which are far leſs than
<i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i>. And ’tis remarkable, that the Bodies of the Planets do not increaſe together with
their Diſtances from the Sun, but that <i>Venus</i> is much bigger than <i>Mars</i>.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Earth juſtly likened to the Planets, and the Planets to it.</i></span> Having thus explained the two Schemes, there’s no Body I ſuppoſe but ſees, that in
the firſt the Earth is made to be of the ſame ſort with the reſt of the Planets. For
the very Poſition of the Circles ſhows it. And that the other Planets are round like
it, and like it receive all the Light they have from the Sun, there’s no room (ſince
the Diſcoveries made by Teleſcopes) to doubt. Another Thing they are like it in is,
that they are moved <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>round their own Axis; for ſince ’tis certain that <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i> are, who can doubt it of the others? Again, as the Earth has its Moon moving round
it, ſo <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i> have theirs. Now ſince in ſo many Things they thus agree, what can be more probable
than that in others they agree too; and that the other Planets are as beautiful and
as well ſtock’d with Inhabitants as the Earth? Or what ſhadow of Reaſon can there
be why they ſhould not?
</p>
<p>If any one ſhould be at the Diſſection of a Dog, and be there ſhewn the Intrails,
the Heart, Stomach, Liver, Lungs and Guts, all the Veins, Arteries and Nerves; could
ſuch a Man reaſonably doubt whether there were the ſame Contexture and Variety of
Parts in a Bullock, Hog, or any other Beaſt, tho’ he had never chanc’d to ſee the
like opening of them? I don’t believe he would. Or were we thoroughly ſatisfy’d in
the Nature of one of the Moons round <i>Jupiter</i>, ſhould not we ſtraight conclude the ſame of the reſt of them? So if we could be
<span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>aſſur’d in but one Comet, what it was that is the Cauſe of that ſtrange Appearance,
ſhould we not make that a Standard to judge of all others by? <span class="marginnote"><i>Arguments from their Similitude, of no ſmall weight.</i></span> ’Tis therefore an Argument of no ſmall Weight that is fetch’d from Relation and Likeneſs;
and to reaſon from what we ſee and are ſure of, to what we cannot, is no falſe Logick.
This muſt be our Method in this Treatiſe, wherein from the Nature and Circumſtances
of that Planet which we ſee before our Eyes, we may gueſs at thoſe that are farther
diſtant from us.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Planets are ſolid, and not without Gravity.</i></span> And, Firſt, ’tis more than probable that the Bodies of the Planets are ſolid like
that of our Earth, and that they don’t want what we call Gravity, that Virtue, which
like a Loadſtone attracts whatſoever is near the Body to its Center. And that they
have ſuch a Quality, their very Figure is a Proof; for their Roundneſs proceeds only
from an equal preſſure of all their Parts tending to the ſame Center. Nay more, we
are ſo skilful now-a-days, as to be able to tell how <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>much more or leſs the Gravitation in <i>Jupiter</i> or <i>Saturn</i> is than here; of which Diſcovery and its Author you may read my <i>Eſſay of the Cauſes of <span class="corr" id="xd31e527" title="Source: Gavitation">Gravitation</span></i>.
</p>
<p>But now to carry the Search farther, let us ſee by what Steps we muſt riſe to the
attaining ſome knowledge in the deeper Secrets concerning the State and Furniture
of theſe new Earths. And, firſt, how likely is it that they may be ſtock’d with Plants
<span class="marginnote"><i>Have Animals and Plants.</i></span> and Animals as well as we? I ſuppoſe no Body will deny but that there’s ſomewhat
more of Contrivance, ſomewhat more wonderful in the Production and Growth of Plants
and Animals, than in Lifeleſs Heaps of inanimate Bodies, be they never ſo much larger;
as Mountains, Rocks, or Seas are. For the Finger of God, and the Wiſdom of Divine
Providence, is in them much more clearly manifeſted than in the other. One of <i>Democritus</i>’s or <span class="corr" id="xd31e537" title="Source: Carte’s"><i>Cartes</i>’s</span> Scholars may venture perhaps to give ſome tolerable Explication of the Appearances
in Heaven and Earth, allow him but his Atoms <span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>and Motion; but when he comes to Plants and Animals, he’ll find himſelf non-plus’d,
and give you no likely account of their Production. For every Thing in them is ſo
exactly adapted to ſome Deſign, every part of them ſo fitted to its proper Uſe, that
they manifeſt an Infinite Wiſdom, and exquiſite Knowledge in the Laws of Nature and
Geometry, as, to omit thoſe Wonders in Generation, we ſhall by and by ſhow; and make
it an Abſurdity even to think of their being thus happily jumbled together by a chance
Motion of I don’t know what little Particles. Now ſhould we allow the Planets nothing
but vaſt Deſerts, lifeleſs and inanimate Stocks and Stones, and deprive them of all
thoſe Creatures that more plainly ſpeak their Divine Architect, we ſhould ſink them
below the Earth in Beauty and Dignity; a Thing very unreasonable, as I ſaid before.
</p>
<p>Well then, we have gain’d the Point thus far, and the Planets may be allowed ſome
Creatures capable of moving themſelves, not at all inferior <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>to ours; and theſe are Animals. And if this be allowed, it almoſt neceſſarily follows,
that there muſt be Herbs <span class="marginnote"><i>Not to be imagin’d too unlike ours.</i></span> for Food for them. And as for the Growth and Nouriſhment of all theſe, ’tis no doubt
the ſame with ours, ſeeing they have the ſame Sun to warm and enliven them as ours
have.
</p>
<p>But perhaps ſome Body may ſay, we conclude too faſt. They will not deny indeed but
that there may be Plants and Animals on the Surface of the Planets, that deſerve as
well to be provided for by their Creator as ours do: but why muſt they be of the ſame
Kind with ours: Nature ſeems to love variety in her Works, and may have made them
widely different from ours either in their matter or manner of Growth, in their outward
Shape, or their inward Contexture; ſhe may have made them ſuch as neither our Underſtanding
nor Imagination can conceive. That’s the Thing we ſhall now examine, and whether it
be not more likely that ſhe has not obſerv’d ſuch a Variety as they talk of. Nature
<span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>ſeems moſt commonly, and in moſt of her Works, to affect Variety, ’tis true; But they
ſhould conſider ’tis not the Buſineſs of Men to pretend to ſettle how great this Difference
and Variety muſt be. Nor does it follow, becauſe it may be Infinite, and out of our
Comprehenſion and Reach, that therefore Things in reality are ſo. For ſuppoſe God
ſhould have pleaſed to have made all Things in the reſt of the Planets juſt as he
has here, the Inhabitants of thoſe Places (if there are any ſuch) would admire his
Wiſdom and Contrivance no leſs than if they were widely different; ſeeing they can’t
come to know what’s done in the other Planets. Who doubts but that God, if he had
pleaſed, might have made the Animals in <i>America</i> and other diſtant Countries nothing like ours? yet we ſee he has not done it. They
have indeed ſome difference in their Shape, and ’tis fit they ſhould, to diſtinguiſh
the Plants and Animals of thoſe Countries from ours, who live on this ſide the Earth;
but even in this Variety there is an Agreement, <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>an exact Correſpondence in Figure and Shape, the ſame ways of Growth, and new Productions,
and of continuing their own Kind. Their Animals have Feet and Wings like ours, and
like ours have Hearts, Lungs, Guts, and the Parts ſerving to Generation; whereas all
theſe Things, as well with them as us, might, if it had pleaſed Infinite Wiſdom, have
been order’d a very different Way. ’Tis plain then that Nature has not exhibited that
Variety in her Works that ſhe could, and therefore we muſt not allow that Weight to
this Argument, as upon the Account of it to make every Thing in the Planets quite
different from what is here. ’Tis more probable that all the Difference there is between
us and them, ſprings from the greater or leſs diſtance and influence from that Fountain
of Heat and Life the Sun; which will cauſe a Difference not ſo much in their Form
and Shape, as in their Matter and Contexture.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Planets have Water.</i></span> And as for the Matter whereof the Plants and Animals there conſiſt, tho’ <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>it is impoſſible ever to come to the Knowledge of its Nature, yet this we may venture
to aſſert (there being ſcarce any Doubt of it) that their Growth and Nouriſhment proceeds
from ſome liquid Principle. For all Philoſophers <span class="corr" id="xd31e568" title="Source: argee">agree</span> that there can be no other way of Nutrition; ſome of the Chief among them having
made Water to be the Original of all Things: For whatſoever’s dry and without Moiſture,
is without Motion too; and without Motion, it’s impoſſible there ſhould be any Increaſe.
But the Parts of a Liquid being in continual Motion one with another, and inſinuating
and twiſting themſelves into the ſmalleſt Places, are thereby very proper and apt
to add not themſelves only, but whatſoever elſe they may bring along with them, to
the Increaſe and Growth of Bodies. Thus we ſee that by the Means of Water the Plants
grow, bloſſom, and bear Fruit; and by the Addition of that only, Stones grow together
out of Sand. And there’s no doubt but that Metals, Cryſtals, and Jewels, <span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>have the ſame Method of Production: Tho’ in them there has been no opportunity to
make the ſame Obſervation, as well by reaſon of their ſlow Advances, as that they
are commonly found far from the Places of their Generation; thrown up I ſuppoſe by
ſome Earthquakes, or Convulſions. That the Planets are not without Water, is made
not improbable by the late Obſervations: For about <i>Jupiter</i> are obſerved ſome Spots of a darker Colour than the reſt of his Body, which by their
continual change ſhow themſelves to be Clouds: For the Spots of <i>Jupiter</i> which belong to him, and never remove from him, are quite different from theſe, being
ſometimes for a long time not to be ſeen for theſe Clouds; and again, when theſe diſappear,
ſhowing themſelves. And at the going off of theſe Clouds, ſome Spots have been taken
notice of in him, much brighter than the reſt of his Body, which remained but a little
while, and then were hid from our Sight. Theſe Monſieur <i>Caſſini</i> thinks are only the <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>Reflection from the Snow that covers the Tops of the Hills in <i>Jupiter</i>: But I ſhould rather think that it is only the Colour of the Earth, which happens
to be free from thoſe Clouds that commonly darken it.
</p>
<p><i>Mars</i> too is found not to be without his dark Spots, by means of which he has been obſerved
to turn round his own Axis in 24 Hours and 40 Minutes; the Length of his Day: but
whether he has Clouds or no, we have not had the ſame opportunity of obſerving as
in <i>Jupiter</i>, as well becauſe even when he is neareſt the Earth, he appears to us much leſs than
<i>Jupiter</i>, as that his Light not coming ſo far, is ſo brisk as to be an Impediment to exact
Obſervations: And this Reaſon is as much ſtronger in <i>Venus</i> as its Light is. But ſince ’tis certain that the Earth and <i>Jupiter</i> have their Water and Clouds, there is no Reaſon why the other Planets <span class="marginnote"><i>But not juſt like ours.</i></span> ſhould be without them. I can’t ſay that they are exactly of the ſame nature with
our Water; but that they ſhould be liquid their Uſe requires, as their Beauty does
that they ſhould be <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>clear. For this Water of ours, in <i>Jupiter</i> or <i>Saturn</i>, would be frozen up inſtantly by reaſon of the vaſt diſtance of the Sun. Every Planet
therefore muſt have its Waters of ſuch a temper, as to be proportioned to its Heat:
<i>Jupiter</i>’s and <i>Saturn</i>’s muſt be of ſuch a Nature as not to be liable to Froſt; and <i>Venus</i>’s and <i>Mercury</i>’s of ſuch, as not to be eaſily evaporated by the Sun. But in all of them, for a continual
ſupply of Moiſture, whatever Water is drawn up by the Heat of the Sun into Vapours,
muſt neceſſarily return back again thither. And this it cannot do but in Drops, which
are cauſed as well there as with us, by their aſcending into a higher and colder Region
of the Air, out of that which, by reaſon of the Reflection of the Rays of the Sun
from the Earth, is warmer and more temperate.
</p>
<p>Here then we have found in theſe new Worlds Fields warm’d by the kindly Heat of the
Sun, and water’d with fruitful Dews and Showers: That there muſt be Plants in them
as well for Ornament as Uſe, we have ſhewn <span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>juſt now. And what Nouriſhment, what manner of Growth ſhall we allow <span class="marginnote"><i>Plants grow and are nouriſhed there as they are here.</i></span> them? Probably, there can be no better, nay no other, than what we here experience;
by having their Roots faſtned into the Earth, and imbibing its nouriſhing Juices by
their tender Fibres. And that they may not be only like ſo many bare Heaths, with
nothing but creeping Shrubs and Buſhes, we may allow them ſome nobler and loftier
Plants, Trees, or ſomewhat like them: Theſe being the greateſt, and, except Waters,
the only Ornament that Nature has beſtowed upon the Earth. For not to ſpeak of thoſe
many uſes that are made of their Wood, there’s no one that is ignorant either of their
Beauty or Pleaſantneſs. Now what way can any one imagine for a continual Production
and Succeſſion of theſe Plants, but their bearing Seed? A Method ſo excellent, that
it’s the only one that Nature has here made uſe of, and ſo wonderful, that it ſeems
to be deſigned not for this Earth alone. In fine, there’s the ſame reaſon to think
that this Method is obſerved in thoſe <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>diſtant Countries, as there was of its being followed in the remote Quarters of this
ſame Earth.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The ſame true of their Animals.</i></span> ’Tis much the ſame in Animals as ’tis in Plants, as to their manner of Nouriſhment,
and Propagation of their Kind. For ſince all the living Creatures of this Earth, whether
Beaſts, Birds, Fiſhes, Worms, or Inſects, univerſally and inviolably follow the ſame
conſtant and fix’d Inſtitution of Nature; all feed on Herbs, or Fruits, or the Fleſh
of other Animals that fed on them: ſince all Generation is performed by the impregnating
of the Eggs, and the Copulation of Male and Female: Why may not the ſame Rule be obſerved
in the Planetary Worlds? For <i>’tis certain that the Herbs and Animals that are there would be loſt, their whole
Species deſtroyed without ſome daily new Productions</i>: except there be no ſuch thing there as Misfortune or Accident: except the Plants
are not like other humid Bodies, but can bear Heat, Froſt, and Age, without being
dry’d up, kill’d or decay’d: except the Animals have Bodies as hard <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>and durable as Marble; which I think are groſs Abſurdities. If we ſhould invent ſome
new Way for their coming into the World, and make them drop like Soland Geeſe from
Trees, how ridiculous would this be to any one that conſiders the vaſt Difference
between Wood and Fleſh? Or ſuppoſe we ſhould have new ones made every Day out of ſome
ſuch fruitful Mud as that of <i>Nile</i>, who does not ſee how contrary this is to all that’s reaſonable? And that ’tis much
more agreeable to the Wiſdom of God, once for all to create of all ſorts of Animals,
and diſtribute them all over the Earth in ſuch a wonderful and inconceivable way as
he has, than to be continually obliged to new Productions out of the Earth? And what
miſerable, what helpleſs Creatures muſt theſe be, when there’s no one that by his
Duty will be obliged, or by that ſtrange natural fondneſs, which God has wiſely made
a neceſſary Argument for all Animals to take care of their own, will be moved to aſſiſt,
nurſe or educate them?
<span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>As for what I have ſaid concerning their Propagation, I cannot be ſo poſitive; but
the other Thing, namely, that they have Plants and Animals, I think I have fully proved,
<i>viz.</i> from hence, that otherwiſe they would be inferiour to our Earth. And by the ſame
Argument, they muſt have as great a Variety of both as we have. What this is, will
be beſt known to him that conſiders the different Ways our Animals make uſe of in
moving from one Place to another. Which may be reduc’d, I think, to theſe, either
that they walk upon two Feet or Four; or like Inſects, upon Six, nay ſometimes Hundreds;
or that they fly in the Air bearing up, and wonderfully ſteering themſelves with their
Wings; or creep upon the Ground without Feet; or by a violent Spring in their Bodies,
or paddling with their Feet, cut themſelves a Way in the Waters. I don’t believe,
nor can I conceive, that there ſhould be any other Way than theſe mentioned. The Animals
then in the Planets muſt make uſe of one or more of theſe, like our amphibious Birds,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>which can ſwim in Water as well as walk on Land, or fly in the Air; or like our Crocodiles
and Sea-Horſes, muſt be Mongrels, between Land and Water. There can no other Method
be imagined but one of theſe. For where is it poſſible for Animals to live, except
upon ſuch a ſolid Body as our Earth, or a fluid one like the Water, or ſtill a more
fluid one than that, ſuch as our Air is? The Air I confeſs may be much thicker and
heavier than ours, and ſo, without any Diſadvantage to its Tranſparency, be fitter
for the volatile Animals. There may alſo be many ſorts of Fluids ranged over one another
in Rows as it were. The Sea perhaps may have ſuch a fluid lying on it, which tho’
ten times lighter than Water, may be a hundred Times heavier than Air; whoſe utmoſt
Extent may not be ſo large as to cover the higher Places of their Earth. But there’s
no Reaſon to ſuſpect or allow them this, ſince we have no ſuch Thing; and if we did,
it would be of no Advantage to them, for that the former Ways of moving would not
be hereby at all increas’d: <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>But when we come to meddle with the Shape of theſe Creatures, and conſider the incredible
Variety that is even in thoſe of the different parts of this Earth, and that <i>America</i> has ſome which are no where elſe to be found, I muſt then confeſs that I think it
beyond the Force of Imagination to arrive at any knowledge in the Matter, or reach
to Probability concerning the Figures of theſe Planetary Animals. Altho’ conſidering
theſe Ways of Motion we e’en now recounted, they may perhaps be no more different
from ours than ours (thoſe of ours I mean that are moſt unlike) are from one another.
</p>
<p>If a Man were admitted to a Survey of <i>Jupiter</i> or <i>Venus</i>, he would no doubt find as great a Number and Variety as he had at home. Let us then,
that we may make as near a Gueſs at, and as reaſonable a Judgment of the Matter as
we can, conſider the many Sorts, and the admirable Difference in the Shapes of our
own Animals; running <span class="marginnote"><i>Great Variety of Animals in this Earth.</i></span> over ſome of the Chief of them (for ’twould be tedious to ſet about a general Catalogue)
that are notoriouſly <span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>different from one another, either in the Figure or ſome peculiar Property belonging
to them; as they belong to the Land, or the Water, or the Air. Among the Beaſts we
may take notice of the great Diſtance between the Horſe, the Elephant, the Lion, the
Stag, the Camel, the Hog, the Ape, the Porcupine, the Tortoiſe, the Cameleon: in the
Water, of that between the Whale, and the Sea-Calf, the Skait, the Pike, the Eel,
the Ink-Fiſh, the Pourcontrel, the Crocodile, the Flying-fiſh, the Cramp-fiſh, the
Crab, the Oiſter, and the Purple-Fiſh: and among Birds, of that between the Eagle,
the Oſtrich, the Peacock, the Swan, the Owl, and the Bat: and in Inſects, of that
between the Ants, the Spider, the Fly, and the Butterfly; and of that Prodigy in their
wonderful change from Worms. In this Roll I have paſs’d by the creeping Kind as one
Sort, and skip’d over that vaſt Multitude of leſs different Animals that fill the
intermediate Spaces. But be they never ſo many, there is no <span class="marginnote"><i>And no leſs in the Planets.</i></span> reaſon to think that the Planets cannot match them. For tho’ we in vain gueſs <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>at the Figures of thoſe Creatures, yet we have diſcover’d ſomewhat of their manner
of Life in general; and of their Senſes we ſhall ſpeak more by and by.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The ſame in Plants.</i></span> The more conſiderable Differences in our Plants ought to be thought on, as well as
the other. As in Trees, that between the Fir and the Oak, the Palm, the Vine, the
Fig, and the Coco-Nut Tree, and that in the <i>Indies</i>, from whoſe Boughs new Roots ſpring, and grow downwards into the Earth. In Herbs,
the Difference is notable between Graſs, Poppy, Colewort, Ivy, Pompions, and the Indian
Fig with thick Leaves growing up without any Stalk, and Aloe. Between every one of
which again there are many leſs differing Plants not taken notice of. Then the different
Ways of raiſing them are remarkable, whether from Seeds, or Kernels, or Roots, or
by grafting or inoculating them. And yet in all theſe, whether we conſider the Things
themſelves, or the Ways of their Production, I make no doubt but that the Planetary
Worlds have as wonderful a Variety as we.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>But ſtill the main and moſt agreeable Point of the Enquiry is behind, <span class="marginnote"><i>Rational Animals in the Planets.</i></span> which is the placing ſome Spectators in theſe new Diſcoveries, to enjoy theſe Creatures
we have planted them with, and to admire their Beauty and Variety. And among all,
that have never ſo ſlightly meddled with theſe Matters, I don’t find any that have
ſcrupled to allow them their Inhabitants: not Men perhaps like ours, but ſome Creatures
or other endued with Reaſon. For all this Furniture and Beauty the Planets are ſtock’d
with ſeem to have been made in vain, without any Deſign or End, unleſs there were
ſome in them that might at the ſame time enjoy the Fruits, and adore the wiſe Creator
of them. But this alone would be no <span class="corr" id="xd31e674" title="Source: prevaling">prevailing</span> Argument with me to allow them ſuch Creatures. For what if we ſhould ſay, that God
made them for no other Deſign, but that he himſelf might ſee (not as we do ’tis true;
but that he that made the Eye ſees, who can doubt?) and delight himſelf in the Contemplation
of them? For was not <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>Man himſelf, and all that the whole World contains, made upon this very account? That
which makes me of this Opinion, that thoſe Worlds are not without ſuch a Creature
endued with Reaſon, is, that otherwiſe our Earth would have too much the Advantage
of them, in being the only part of the Univerſe that could boaſt of ſuch a Creature
ſo far above, not only Plants and Trees, but all Animals whatſoever: a Creature that
has ſomething Divine in him, that knows, and underſtands, and remembers ſuch an innumerable
number of Things; that deliberates, weighs and judges of the Truth: A Creature upon
whoſe Account, and for whoſe Uſe, whatſoever the Earth brings forth ſeems to be provided.
For every Thing here he converts to his own Ends. With the Trees, Stones, and Metals,
he builds himſelf Houſes: the Birds and Fiſhes he ſuſtains himſelf with: and the Water
and Winds he makes ſubſervient to his Navigation, as he doth the ſweet Smell and glorious
Colours of the Flowers to his Delight. What can there be <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>in the Planets that can make up for its Defects in the want of ſo noble an Animal?
If we ſhould allow <i>Jupiter</i> a greater Variety of other Creatures, more Trees, Herbs and Metals, all theſe would
not advantage or dignify that Planet ſo much as that one Animal doth ours by the admirable
Productions of his penetrating Wit. If I am miſtaken in this, I do not know when to
truſt my Reaſon, and muſt allow my ſelf to be but a poor Judge in the true Eſtimate
of Things.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Vices of Men no hindrance to their being the Glory of the Planet they inhabit.</i></span> Nor let any one ſay here, that there’s ſo much Villany and Wickedneſs in Man that
we have thus magnified, that it’s a reaſonable Doubt, whether he would not be ſo far
from being the Glory and Ornament of the Planet that enjoys his Company, that he would
be rather its Shame and Diſgrace. For firſt, the Vices that moſt Men are tainted with,
are no hindrance, but that thoſe that follow the Dictates of true Reaſon, and obey
the Rules of a rigid Virtue, are ſtill a Beauty and Ornament to the Place that has
the Happineſs to harbour them. <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>Beſides, the Vices of Men themſelves are of excellent Uſe, and are not permitted and
allowed in the World without wiſe Deſign. For ſince it has ſo pleaſed God to order
the Earth, and every Thing in it as we ſee it is (for it’s abſurd to ſay it happen’d
againſt his Will or Knowledge) we muſt not think that ſo great a Diverſity of Minds
were placed in different Men to no End or Purpoſe: but that this mixture of bad Men
with Good, and the Conſequents of ſuch a Mixture, as Misfortunes, Wars, Afflictions,
Poverty, and the like, were permitted for this very good End, <i>viz.</i> the exerciſing our Wits, and ſharpening our Inventions; by forcing us to provide
for our own neceſſary Defence againſt our Enemies. ’Tis to the Fear of Poverty and
Miſery that we are beholden for all our Arts, and for that natural Knowledge which
was the Product of laborious Induſtry; and which makes us that we cannot but admire
the Power and Wiſdom of the Creator, which otherwiſe we might have paſſed by with
the ſame indifference as Beaſts. And if Men <span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>were to lead their whole Lives in an undiſturbed continual Peace, in no fear of Poverty,
no danger of War, I doubt they would live little better than Brutes, without all knowledge
or enjoyment of thoſe Advantages that make our Lives paſs on with Pleaſure and Profit.
We ſhould want the wonderful Art of Writing, if its great Uſe and neceſſity in Commerce
and War had not forced out the Invention. ’Tis to theſe we owe our Art of Sailing,
our Art of Sowing, and moſt of thoſe Diſcoveries of which we are Maſters; and almoſt
all the Secrets in experimental Knowledge. So that thoſe very Things on account of
which the Faculty of Reaſon ſeems to have been accuſed, are no ſmall helps to its
Advancement and Perfection. For thoſe Virtues themſelves, Fortitude and Conſtancy,
would be of no uſe if there were no Dangers, no Adverſity, no Afflictions for their
Exerciſe and Trial.
</p>
<p>If we ſhould therefore imagine in the Planets ſome ſuch reaſonable Creature as Man
is, adorn’d with the ſame <span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>Virtues, and liable to the ſame Vices, it would be ſo far from degrading or vilifying
them, that while they want ſuch a one, I muſt think them inferior to our Earth.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Reaſon <span class="corr" id="xd31e701" title="Source: there">they are</span> not different from what ’tis here.</i></span> But if we allow theſe Planetary Inhabitants ſome ſort of Reaſon, muſt it needs, may
ſome ſay, be the ſame with ours? Certainly it muſt, whether we conſider it as applied
to Juſtice and Morality, or exerciſed in the Principles and Foundations of Science.
For Reaſon with us is that which gives us a true Senſe of Juſtice and Honeſty, Praiſe,
Kindneſs and Gratitude: ’tis That that teaches us to diſtinguiſh univerſally between
Good and Bad; and renders us capable of Knowledge and Experience in it. And can there
be any where any other Sort of Reaſon than this? or can what we call juſt and generous,
in <i>Jupiter</i> or <i>Mars</i> be thought unjuſt Villany? This is not at all, I don’t ſay probable, but poſſible.
For the Aim and Deſign of the Creator is every where the Preſervation and Safety of
his Creatures. Now when ſuch Reaſon as we are Maſters <span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>of, is neceſſary for the preſervation of Life, and promoting of Society (a thing that
they are not without, as we ſhall ſhow) would it not be ſtrange that the Planetary
Inhabitants ſhould have ſuch a perverſe Sort of Reaſon given them, as would neceſſarily
deſtroy and confound what it was deſign’d to maintain and defend? But allowing Morality
and Paſſions with thoſe diſtant Inhabitants to be ſomewhat different from ours, and
ſuppoſing they may act by other Principles in what belongs to Friendſhip and Anger,
Hatred, Honeſty, Modeſty, and Comelineſs, yet ſtill there would be no doubt, but that
in the Search after Truth, in judging of the Conſequences of Things, in Reaſoning,
particularly in that Sort which belongs to Magnitude or Quantity, about which their
Geometry (if they have ſuch a Thing) is employ’d, there would be no doubt, I ſay,
but that their Reaſon here muſt be exactly the ſame, and go the ſame way to work with
ours, and that what’s true in one part will hold true over the whole Univerſe; ſo
that all the difference <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>muſt lie in the Degrees of Knowledge, which will be proportional to the Genius and
Capacity of the Inhabitants.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>They have Senſes.</i></span> But I perceive I am got ſomewhat too far: Let us firſt enquire a little concerning
the bodily Senſes of theſe Planetary Perſons; for without ſuch, neither will Life
be any Pleaſure to them, nor Reaſon of any Uſe. And I think it very probable, that
all their Animals, as well their Beaſts as rational Creatures, are like ours in all
that relates to the Senſes: For without the Power of Seeing we ſhould find it impoſſible
for Animals to provide Food for themſelves, or be ſore-warn’d of any approaching Danger,
ſo as to guard themſelves from it. So that where-ever we plant any Animals, except
we wou’d have them lead the Life of Worms or Moles, we muſt allow them Sight; than
which nothing can conduce more either to the Preſervation or Pleaſure of their Lives.
Then if we conſider the wonderful Nature of Light, and the <span class="marginnote"><i>Sight.</i></span> amazing Artifice in the fit framing the Eye for the Reception of it, we cannot <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>but ſee that Bodies ſo vaſtly remote could not be perceived by us in their proper
Figures and juſt Diſtances, any other way than by Sight. For this Senſe, and all others
that we know of, muſt proceed from an external Motion. Which in the ſenſe of Seeing
muſt come either from the Sun, the fix’d Stars, or Fire: whoſe Particles being put
into a very quick Motion, communicate it to the Celeſtial Matter about, whence ’tis
convey’d in a very ſhort time to the moſt diſtant parts, juſt like Sound through the
Air. If it were not for this Motion of the intermediate Ætherial Matter, we ſhould
be all in Darkneſs, and have Sight neither of Sun nor Stars, nor any thing elſe, for
all other Light muſt come to us by Reflection from them. This Motion perceived by
the Eyes is called Light. And the nice Curioſity of this Perception is admirable,
in that it is cauſed by the ſmalleſt Particles of the luminous Body brought to us
by that fine Matter, which at the ſame time determine the Coaſt from whence the Motion
comes; and in that all theſe different Roads of <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>Motion, theſe Waves croſſing and interfering with one another, are yet no hindrance
to every one’s free Paſſage. All theſe Things are ſo wiſely, ſo wonderfully contrived,
that it’s above the Power of humane Wit, to invent or frame any thing like them; nay,
it is very difficult ſo much as to imagine and comprehend them. For what can be more
amazing, than that one ſmall Part of the Body ſhould be ſo deviſed and framed, as
by its means to ſhow us the Shape, the Poſition, the Diſtance, and all the Motions,
nay, and all the Colours, of a Body that is far remote from us, that it may appear
the more diſtinct? And then the artful Compoſition of the Eye, drawing an exact Picture
of the Objects without it, upon the concave Side of the Choroides, is even above all
Admiration, nor is there any Thing in which God has more plainly manifeſted his excellent
Geometry. And theſe Things are not only contriv’d and fram’d with ſo great Wiſdom
and Skill, as not to admit of better, but to any one that conſiders them attentively,
they ſeem to be of ſuch a Nature <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>as not to allow any other Method. For it’s impoſſible that Light ſhould repreſent
Objects to us at ſo vaſt a diſtance, except by ſuch an intervening Motion; and it’s
as impoſſible that any other Compoſition of the Eye ſhould be equally fitted to the
Reception of ſuch Impreſſions. So that I cannot but think them greatly miſtaken, that
maintain theſe Things might have been contrived many other Ways. It’s likely then,
and credible, that in theſe Things the Planets have an exact correſpondence with us,
and that their Animals have the ſame Organs, and uſe the ſame way of Sight that we
do. They muſt have Eyes therefore, and two at leaſt we muſt grant them, otherwiſe
they would not perceive thoſe Things cloſe to them, nor hardly be able to walk about
with Safety. And if we muſt allow them to all Animals for the Preſervation of their
Life, how much more muſt they that make more, and more noble Uſes of them, not be
deprived of the Bleſſing of ſo advantageous Members? For by them we view the various
Flowers, and the elegant Features of Beauty: with <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>them we read, we write, we contemplate the Heavens and Stars, and meaſure their Diſtances,
Magnitudes, and Journeys: which how far they are common to the Inhabitants of thoſe
Worlds with us, I ſhall preſently examine. But firſt I ſhall enquire whether now we
have given them one, we ought alſo to give them the other <span class="marginnote"><i>Hearing.</i></span> four Senſes. And indeed as to Hearing many Arguments perſwade me to give it a Share
in the Animals of thoſe new Worlds. For ’tis of great conſequence in defending us
from ſudden Accidents; and, eſpecially when Seeing is of no uſe to us, it ſupplies
its Place, and gives us ſeaſonable warning of any imminent Danger. Beſides, we ſee
many Animals call their Fellow to them with their Voice, which Language may have more
in it than we are aware of, tho’ we don’t underſtand it. But if we do but conſider
the vaſt Uſes and neceſſary Occaſions of Speaking on the one ſide, and Hearing on
the other, among thoſe Creatures that make uſe of their Reaſon, it will ſcarce ſeem
credible that two ſuch uſeful, ſuch <span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>excellent Things were deſigned only for us. For how is it poſſible but that they that
are without theſe, muſt be without many other Neceſſaries and Conveniences of Life?
Or what can they have to recompenſe this Want? Then, if we go ſtill farther, and do
but meditate upon the neat and frugal Contrivance of Nature in making the ſame Air,
by the drawing in of which we live, by whoſe Motion we ſail, and by whoſe Means Birds
fly, for a Conveyance of Sound to our Ears; and this Sound for the Conveyance of another
Man’s Thoughts to our Minds: Can we ever imagine that ſhe has left thoſe other Worlds
deſtitute of ſo vaſt <span class="marginnote"><i>A Medium to convey Sound to the Ears.</i></span> Advantages? That they don’t want the Means of them is certain, for their having Clouds
in <i>Jupiter</i> puts it paſt doubt that they have Air too; that being moſtly formed of the Particles
of Water flying about, as the Clouds are of them gathered into ſmall Drops. And another
Proof of it is, the neceſſity of breathing for the preſervation of Life, a Thing that
ſeems to be as univerſal a Dictate of Nature, as feeding upon the Fruits of the Earth.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Touch.</i></span> As for Feeling, it ſeems to be given upon neceſſity to all Creatures that are cover’d
with a fine and ſenſible Skin, as a Caution againſt coming too near thoſe Things that
may injure or incommode them: and without it they would be liable to continual Wounds,
Blows and Bruiſes. Nature ſeems to have been ſo ſenſible of this, that ſhe has not
left the leaſt place free from ſuch a Perception. Therefore it’s probable that the
Inhabitants of thoſe Worlds are not without ſo neceſſary a Defence, and ſo fit a Preſervative
againſt Dangers and Miſhaps.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Smell and Taſte.</i></span> And who is there that doth not ſee the inevitable neceſſity for all Creatures that
live by feeding to have both Taſte and Smell, that they may diſtinguiſh thoſe Things
that are good and nouriſhing, from thoſe that are miſchievous and harmful? If therefore
we allow the Planetary Creatures to feed upon Herbs, Seeds, or Fleſh, we muſt allow
them Taſte and Smell, that they may chuſe or refuſe any Thing according as they find
it likely to be advantageous or noxious to them.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>I know that it hath been a Queſtion with many, whether there might not have been more
Senſes than theſe five. <span class="marginnote"><i>Their Senſes not very different from ours.</i></span> If we ſhould allow this, it might nevertheleſs be reaſonably doubted, whether the
Senſes of the Planetary Inhabitants are much different from ours. I muſt confeſs,
I cannot deny but there might poſſibly have been more Senſes; but when I conſider
the Uſes of thoſe we have, I cannot think but they would have been ſuperfluous. The
Eye was made to diſcern near and remote Objects, the Ear to give us notice of what
our Eyes could not, either in the Dark or behind our Back: Then what neither the Eye
nor the Ear could, the Noſe was made (which in Dogs is wonderfully nice) to warn us
of. And if any thing eſcapes the notice of the other four Senſes, we have Feeling
to inform us of the too near Approaches of it before it can do us any miſchief. Thus
has Nature ſo plentifully, ſo perfectly provided for the neceſſary preſervation of
her Creatures here, that I think ſhe can give nothing more to thoſe there, but what
<span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>will be needleſs and ſuperfluous. Yet the Senſes were not wholly deſigned for uſe:
but Men from all, and all other Animals from ſome of them, reap Pleaſure as well as
Profit, as from the Taſte in delicious Meats; from the Smell in Flowers and Perfumes;
from the Sight in the Contemplation of beauteous Shapes and Colours; from the Hearing
in the Sweetneſs and Harmony of Sounds; from the Feeling in Copulation, unleſs you
pleaſe to count that for a particular Senſe by it ſelf. <span class="marginnote"><i>They have Pleaſure ariſing from the Senſes.</i></span> Since it is thus, I think ’tis but reaſonable to allow the Inhabitants of the Planets
theſe ſame Advantages that we have from them. For upon this Conſideration only, how
much happier and eaſier a Man’s Life is rendred by the enjoyment of them, we muſt
be obliged to grant them theſe Bleſſings, except we would engroſs every thing that
is good to our ſelves, as if we were worthier and more deſerving than any elſe. But
moreover, that Pleaſure which we perceive in Eating or in Copulation, ſeems to be
a neceſſary and provident Command of Nature, <span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>whereby it tacitly compels us to the preſervation and continuance of our Life and
Kind. It is the ſame in Beaſts. So that both for their Happineſs and Preſervation
it’s very probable the reſt of the Planets are not without it. Certainly when I conſider
all theſe Things, how great, noble, and uſeful they are; when I conſider what an admirable
Providence it is that there’s ſuch a Thing as Pleaſure in the World, I can’t but think
that our Earth, the ſmalleſt part almoſt of the Univerſe, was never deſign’d to monopolize
ſo great a Bleſſing. And thus much for thoſe Pleaſures which affect our bodily Senſes,
but have little or no relation to our Reaſon and Mind. But there are other Pleaſures
which Men enjoy, which their Soul only and Reaſon can reliſh: Some airy and brisk,
others grave and ſolid, and yet nevertheleſs Pleaſures, as ariſing from the Satisfaction
which we feel in Knowledge and Inventions, and Searches after Truth, of which whether
the Planetary Inhabitants are not partakers, we ſhall have an opportunity of enquiring
by and by. There
<span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span></p>
<p>There are ſome other things to be conſider’d firſt, in which it’s probable they have
ſome relation to us. That the Planets have thoſe Elements of Earth, Air and Water,
as well as we, I have already made not unlikely. Let us now ſee whether they may not
have Fire alſo: which is not ſo properly call’d an Element, as a very quick Motion
of the Particles in the <span class="corr" id="xd31e765" title="Source: inflamable">inflammable</span> <span class="marginnote"><i>All the Planets have Fire.</i></span> Body. But be it what it will, there are many Arguments for their not being without
it. For this Earth is not ſo truly call’d the Place of Fire as the Sun: and as by
the Heat of that all Plants and Animals here thrive and live; ſo, no doubt, it is
in the other Planets. Since then Fire is cauſed by a moſt intenſe and vigorous Heat,
it follows that the Planets, eſpecially thoſe nearer the Fountain of it, have their
proportionate degrees of Heat and Fire. And ſince there are ſo many ways of its Production,
as by the collection of the Rays of the Sun, by the reflection of Mirrors, by the
ſtriking of Flint and Steel, by the rubbing of Wood, by the cloſe loading of <span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>moiſt Graſs, by Lightning, by the eruptions of Mountains and Volcanos, it’s ſtrange
if neither Art ſhould have produced it, nor Nature effected it there by one of theſe
many means. Then how uſeful and neceſſary is it to us? By it we drive away Cold, and
ſupply the want of the Sun in thoſe Countries where his oblique Rays make a leſs vigorous
Impreſſion, and ſo keep a great part of the Earth from being an uninhabited <span class="corr" id="xd31e773" title="Source: Deſart">Deſert</span>: which is equally neceſſary in all the Planets, whether we allow them Succeſſion
of Seaſons, or a perpetual Spring and Æquinox: for even then the Countries near the
Pole would receive but little Advantage from the Heat of the Sun. By the help of this
we turn the Night into Day, and thereby make a conſiderable addition to the ſhortneſs
of our Lives. Upon all theſe Accounts we ought not to think this Earth of ours enjoy
it all alone, and exclude all the other Planets from ſo advantageous and ſo profitable
a Gift.
</p>
<p>But perhaps it may be asked as well concerning Brutes as rational Creatures, <span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>and of their Plants and Trees too, whether they are proportionably <span class="marginnote"><i>The bigneſs of their Creatures not rightly gueſt at by the bigneſs of the Planets.</i></span> larger or leſs than ours. For if the Magnitude of the Planets was to be the Standard
of their meaſure, there would be Animals in <i>Jupiter</i> ten or fifteen times larger than Elephants, and as much longer than our Whales, and
then their Men muſt be all Giants in reſpect to us. Now tho’ I don’t ſee any ſo great
Abſurdity in this as to make it impoſſible, yet there is no reaſon to think it is
really ſo, ſeeing Nature has not always ty’d her ſelf to thoſe Rules which we have
thought more convenient for her: For example, the Magnitude of the Planets is not
anſwerable to their diſtances from the Sun; but <i>Mars</i>, tho’ more remote, is far leſs than <i>Venus</i>: and <i>Jupiter</i> turns round his Axis in ten Hours, when the Earth which is much leſs than him, ſpends
24. But ſince Nature, perhaps ſome will ſay, has not obſerved ſuch a Regularity in
the proportion of Things, for ought we know there may be only a Race of Pygmies about
the Bigneſs of Frogs and Mice, <span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span><span class="corr" id="xd31e793" title="Source: ſeſs’d">poſſeſs’d</span> of the Planets. But I ſhall ſhow that this is very improbable by and by.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>In the Planets are ſorts of rational Creatures as well as here.</i></span> There may ariſe another Queſtion, whether there be in the Planets but one ſort of
rational Creatures, or if there be not ſeveral ſorts poſſeſſed of different degrees
of Reaſon and Senſe. There is ſomething not unlike this to be obſerved among us. For
to paſs by thoſe who have human Shape (altho’ ſome of them would very well bear that
Enquiry too) if we do but conſider ſome ſorts of Beaſts, as the Dog, the Ape, the
Beaver, the Elephant, nay ſome Birds and Bees, what Senſe and Underſtanding they are
maſters of, we ſhall be forced to allow, that Man is not the only rational Animal.
For we diſcover ſomewhat in them of Reaſon independent on, and prior to all Teaching
and Practice.
</p>
<p>But ſtill no Body can doubt, but that the Underſtanding and Reaſon of Man is to be
preferr’d to theirs, as being comprehenſive of innumerable Things, indued with an
infinite memory of what’s paſt, and capable of providing <span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>againſt what’s to come. That there is ſome ſuch Species of rational Creatures in the
other Planets, which is the Head and Sovereign of the reſt, is very reaſonable to
believe: for otherwiſe, were many Species endued with the ſame Wiſdom and Cunning,
we ſhould have them always doing Miſchief, always quarrelling and fighting one with
another for Empire and Sovereignty, a Thing that we feel too much of where we have
but one ſuch Species. But to let that paſs, our next Enquiry ſhall be concerning thoſe
Animals in the Planets which are furniſhed with the greateſt Reaſon, whether it’s
poſſible to know wherein they employ it, and whether they have made as great Advances
in Arts and Knowledge as we in our Planet. Which deſerves moſt to be conſidered and
examined of any thing belonging to their Nature; and for the better Performance of
it we muſt take our Riſe ſomewhat higher, and nicely view the Lives and Studies of
Men.
</p>
<p>And in thoſe things wherein Men provide and take care only of what’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>abſolutely neceſſary for the preſervation of their Life; in defending themſelves from
the Injuries of the Air; in ſecuring themſelves againſt the Incurſions of Enemies
by Walls; and againſt Fraud and Diſturbances by Laws; in educating their Children,
and providing for themſelves and them: In all theſe I can ſee no great reaſon that
Man has to boaſt of the Pre-eminency of his Reaſon above Beaſts and other Animals.
For moſt of theſe Things they perform with greater Eaſe and Art than we, and ſome
of them they have no need of. For that Senſe of Virtue and Juſtice in which Man excels,
of Friendſhip, Gratitude and Honeſty, of what uſe are they, but either to put a ſtop
to the Wickedneſs of Man, or to ſecure us from mutual Aſſaults and Injuries, Things
wherein the Beaſts want no Guide but Nature and Inclination? Then if we ſet before
our Eyes the manifold Cares, the Diſturbances of Mind, the reſtleſs Deſires, the dread
of Death, that are the reſult of this our Reaſon; and compare them with <span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>that eaſy, quiet, and harmleſs Life which other Animals enjoy, we ſhould be apt to
wiſh a Change, and conclude that they, eſpecially Birds, lived with more Pleaſure
and Happineſs than Man could with all his Wiſdom. For they have as great a Reliſh
of bodily Pleaſures as we, let the new Philoſophers ſay what they will, who would
have them to be nothing but Clocks and Engines of Fleſh; a Thing which Beaſts ſo plainly
confute by crying and running away from a Stick, and all other Actions, that I wonder
how any one could ſubſcribe to ſo abſurd and cruel an Opinion. Nay, I can ſcarce doubt
but that Birds feel no ſmall Pleaſure in their eaſy, ſmooth ſailing through the Air;
and would much more if they but knew the Advantages it hath above our ſlow and <span class="marginnote"><i>Men chiefly differ from Beaſts in the Study of Nature.</i></span> laborious Progreſſion. What is it then after all that ſets human Reaſon above all
other, and makes us preferable to the reſt of the Animal World? Nothing in my Mind
ſo much as the Contemplation of the Works of God, and the Study of Nature, and the
improving <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>thoſe Sciences which may bring us to ſome knowledge in their Beauty and Variety. For
without Knowledge what would be Contemplation? And what difference is there between
a Man, who with a careleſs ſupine Negligence views the Beauty and Uſe of the Sun,
and the fine golden Furniture of the Heaven, and one who with a learned Niceneſs ſearches
into their Courſes; who underſtands wherein the Fix’d Stars, as they are call’d, differ
from the Planets, and what is the Reaſon of the regular Viciſſitude of the Seaſons;
who by ſound Reaſoning can meaſure the Magnitude and Diſtance of the Sun and Planets?
Or between ſuch a one as admires perhaps the nimble Activity and ſtrange Motions of
ſome Animals, and one that knows their whole Structure, underſtands the whole Fabrick
and Architecture of their Compoſition? If therefore the Principle we before laid down
be true, that the other Planets are not inferiour in Dignity to ours, <span class="marginnote"><i>They have Aſtronomy.</i></span> what follows but that they have Creatures not to ſtare and wonder at the <span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>Works of Nature only, but who employ their Reaſon in the Examination and Knowledge
of them, and have made as great Advances therein as we have? They do not only view
the Stars, but they improve the Science of Aſtronomy: nor is there any thing can make
us think this improbable, but that fond Conceitedneſs of every Thing that we call
our own, and that Pride that is too natural to us to be eaſily laid down. But I know
ſome will ſay, we are a little too bold in theſe Aſſertions of the Planets, and that
we mounted hither by many Probabilities, one of which, if it chance to be falſe, and
contrary to our Suppoſition, would, like a bad Foundation, ruin the whole Building,
and make it fall to the Ground. But I would have them to know, that all I have ſaid
of their Knowledge in Aſtronomy, has Proofs enough, antecedent to thoſe we now produced.
For ſuppoſing the Earth, as we did, one of the Planets of equal Dignity and Honour
with the reſt, who would venture to ſay, that no where elſe were to be found any that
<span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>enjoy’d the glorious Sight of Nature’s Theatre? Or if there were any Fellow-Spectators,
yet we were the only ones that had dived deep into the Secrets and Knowledge of it?
So that here’s a Proof not ſo far fetch’d for the Aſtronomy of the Planets, the ſame
which we uſed for their having rational Creatures, and enjoying the other Advantages
we before talk’d of, which ſerves at the ſame time for the Confirmation of our former
Conjectures. But if Amazement and Fear at the Eclipſes of the Moon and Sun gave the
firſt occaſion to the Study of Aſtronomy, as probably they did, then it’s almoſt impoſſible
that <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i> ſhould be without it; the Argument being of much greater force in them, by reaſon
of the daily Eclipſes of their Moons, and the frequent ones of the Sun to their Inhabitants.
So that if a Perſon diſintereſted in his Judgment, and equally ignorant of the Affairs
of all the Planets, were to give his Opinion in this Matter, I don’t doubt he would
give the Cauſe for Aſtronomy to thoſe two Planets rather than us.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span></p>
<p>This Suppoſition of their Knowledge and Uſe of Aſtronomy in the Planetary Worlds,
will afford us many new Conjectures about their manner of Life, and their State as
to other things.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>And all its ſubſervient Arts.</i></span> For, Firſt: No Obſervations of the Stars that are neceſſary to the Knowledge of their
Motions, can be made without Inſtruments; nor can theſe be made without Metal, Wood,
or ſome ſuch ſolid Body. Here’s a neceſſity of allowing them the Carpenters Tools,
the Saw, the Ax, the Plane, the Mallet, the File: and the making of theſe requires
the Uſe of Iron, or ſome equally hard Metal. <span class="marginnote"><i>Geometry and Arithmetick</i>:</span> Again, theſe Inſtruments can’t be without a Circle divided into equal Parts, or a
ſtrait Line into unequal. Here’s a neceſſity for introducing Geometry and Arithmetick.
Then the Neceſſity <span class="marginnote"><i>And Writing.</i></span> in ſuch Obſervations of marking down the Epochas or Accounts of Time, and of tranſmitting
them to Poſterity, will force us to grant them the Art of Writing; perhaps very different
from ours which is commonly uſed, but I dare affirm not more ingenious <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>or eaſy. For how much more ready and expeditious is our Way, than by that multitude
of Characters uſed in <i>China</i>; and how vaſtly preferable to Knots tied in Cords, or the Pictures in uſe among the
barbarous People of <i>Mexico</i> and <i>Peru</i>? There’s no Nation in the World but has ſome way or other of writing or marking down
their Thoughts: So that it’s no wonder if the Planetary Inhabitants have been taught
it by that great School-miſtreſs Neceſſity, and apply it to the Study of Aſtronomy
and other Sciences. In Aſtronomical Matters the Neceſſity of it is moreover apparent
from hence, that the Motion of the Stars is as ’twere to be fancied and gueſs’d at
in different Syſtems, and theſe Syſtems to be continually improved and corrected,
as later and more exact Obſervations ſhall convince the old ones of Faults: all which
can never be deliver’d down to ſucceeding Generations, unleſs we make uſe of Letters
and Figures.
</p>
<p>But after all theſe large and liberal Allowances to Them, they will ſtill <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>be behind-hand with us. For we have ſo certain a Knowledge of the true <span class="marginnote"><i>And Opticks.</i></span> Syſtem and Frame of the Univerſe; we have ſo admirable an Invention of Teleſcopes
to help our failing Eye-ſight in the view of the Bigneſs and different Forms of the
Planetary Bodies, in the diſcovery of the Mountains, and the Shadows of them on the
Surface of the Moon, in the bringing to light an innumerable multitude of Stars otherwiſe
inviſible, that we muſt neceſſarily be far their Maſters in that Knowledge. Hence
it is almoſt neceſſary (except we have a Mind to flatter and complement our ſelves
as the only People that have the Advantage of ſuch excellent Inventions) either to
allow the Planetary Inhabitants ſuch ſharp Eyes as not to need them, or elſe the uſe
of Glaſſes to help the Deficiency of their Sight. And yet I dare not aſſert this,
leſt any one ſhould be ſo diſturbed at the Extravagancy of ſuch an Opinion, as to
take the meaſure of my other Conjectures by it, and hiſs them all off, upon the account
of this alone.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Theſe Sciences not contrary to Nature.</i></span> But ſome Body may perhaps object, and that not without reaſon at firſt ſight, that
the Planetary Inhabitants it’s likely are deſtitute of all refined Knowledge, juſt
as the <i>Americans</i> were before they had Commerce with the <i>Europeans</i>. For if one conſiders the Ignorance of thoſe Nations, and of others in <i>Aſia</i> and <i>Africa</i> equally barbarous, it will appear as if the main Deſign of the Creator in placing
Men upon the Earth was that they might live, and, in a juſt ſenſe of all the Bleſſings
and Pleaſure they enjoy, worſhip the Fountain of their Happineſs; but that ſome few
went beyond the Bounds of Nature in their Enquiries after Knowledge. There does not
want an Anſwer to theſe Men. For God could not but foreſee the Advances Men would
make, in their enquiring into the Heavenly Bodies: that they would diſcover Arts uſeful
and advantageous to Life: that they would croſs the Seas, and dig up the Bowels of
the Earth. Nothing of all this could happen contrary to the Mind and Knowledge of
the Infinite Author of all Things. And if <span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>he foreſaw theſe Things would be, he ſo appointed and deſtin’d them to humane kind.
And the Studies of Arts and Sciences cannot be ſaid to be contrary to Nature, ſince
in the ſearch thereof they are employ’d: eſpecially if we conſider how great the natural,
deſire and love of Knowledge, rooted in all Men is. For it’s impoſſible this ſhould
have been given them upon no Deſign or Account. But they will urge, that if ſuch a
Knowledge is natural, if we were born for it, why are there ſo very few, eſpecially
in Aſtronomy, that proſecute theſe Studies? For <i>Europe</i> is the only Quarter of the Earth in which there have been any Advancements made in
Aſtronomy. And as for the Judicial Aſtrology, which pretends to foretel what is to
come, it is ſuch a wretched and oftentimes miſchievous piece of Madneſs, that I do
not think it ought to be ſo much as named here. And even in <i>Europe</i>, not one in a hundred Thouſand meddles with theſe Studies. Beſides, its <span class="sic" title="Correction: Origin">Original</span> and Riſe is ſo late, that many Ages were paſt before <span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>the very firſt Rudiments of Aſtronomy or Geometry (which is neceſſary to the learning
of it) were known. For every Body is acquainted almoſt with its firſt Beginnings in
<i>Egypt</i> and <i>Greece</i>. Add to this, that ’tis not yet above fourſcore Years ſince the bungling Epicycles
were diſcarded, and the true and eaſy plain Motion of the Planets was diſcovered.
For the Satisfaction of theſe Scruples, to what we ſaid before, concerning the Fore-knowledge
of God, may be added this; That God never deſigned we ſhould come into the World Aſtronomers
or Philoſophers; theſe Arts are not infuſed into us at our Birth, but were ordered,
in long Tracts of Time, by degrees to be the Rewards and Reſult of laborious Diligence;
eſpecially thoſe Sciences which are now in debate, are ſo much the more difficult
and abſtruſe, that their late Invention and ſlow Progreſs are ſo far from being a
Wonder, that it is rather ſtrange they were ever diſcover’d at all. There are but
few, I acknowledge one or two perhaps in an Age, that purſue them, <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>or think them their Buſineſs: but their Number will be very conſiderable if we take
in thoſe that have lived in all the Ages in which Aſtronomy hath flouriſhed: and no
Body can deny them that Happineſs and Contentment which they have pretended to above
all others. In fine, it was ſufficient that ſo ſmall a Number ſhould make it their
Study, ſo that the Profit and Advantage of their Inventions might but ſpread it ſelf
over all the World. Since then the Inhabitants of this Earth, let them be never ſo
few, have had Parts and Genius ſufficient for the Attainment of this Knowledge; and
there’s no reaſon to think the Planetary Inhabitants leſs ingenious or happy than
our ſelves; we have gain’d our Point, and ’tis probable that they are as skilful Aſtronomers
as we can pretend to be. So that now we may venture to deduce ſome Conſequences from
ſuch a Suppoſition.
</p>
<p>We have before ſhow’d the neceſſary Dependence and Connexion, not only of Geometry
and Arithmetick, but of Mechanical Arts and Inſtruments with this Science. This leads
<span class="pageNum" id="pb71">[<a href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>us naturally to the Enquiry how they can uſe theſe Inſtruments and Engines for the
Obſervation of the Stars, how they can write down ſuch their Obſervations, and perform
other Things which we do with our Hands. So that we muſt neceſſarily give them <span class="marginnote"><i>They have Hands.</i></span> Hands, or ſome other Member, as convenient for all those Uſes, inſtead of them. One
of the ancient Philoſophers laid ſuch Streſs upon the Uſe and Conveniency of the Hands,
that he made no ſcruple to affirm, they were the Cauſe and Foundation of all our Knowledge.
By which, I ſuppoſe, he meant no more, than that without their Help and Aſſiſtance
Men could never arrive to the Improvement of their Minds in natural Knowledge: And
indeed not without Reaſon. For ſuppoſe inſtead of them they had had Hoofs like Horſes
or Bullocks given them, they might have laid indeed the Model and Deſign of Cities
and Houſes in their Head, but they would never have been able to have built them.
They would have had no Subject of Diſcourſe but what belong’d to their <span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>Victuals, Marriages, or Self-preſervation. They would have been void of all Knowledge
and Memory, and indeed would have been but one degree diſtant from brute Beaſts. What
could we invent or imagine that could be ſo exactly accommodated to all the deſign’d
Uſes as the Hands are? Elephants can lay hold of, or throw any thing with their Proboſcis,
can take up even the ſmalleſt Things from the Ground, and can perform ſuch ſurpriſing
Things with it, that it has not very improperly been call’d their Hand, tho’ indeed
it is nothing but a Noſe ſomewhat longer than ordinary. Nor do Birds ſhow leſs Art
and Deſign in the Uſe of their Bills in the picking up their Meat, and the wonderful
Compoſure of their Neſts. But all this is nothing to thoſe Conveniences the Hand is
ſo admirably ſuited to; nothing to that amazing Contrivance in its Capacity of being
ſtretched, or contracted, or turned to any Part as Occaſion ſhall require. And then,
to paſs by that nice Senſe that the Ends of the Fingers are endued with, even to the
feeling and <span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>diſtinguiſhing moſt ſorts of Bodies in the Dark, what Wiſdom and Art is ſhow’d in
the Diſpoſition of the Thumb and Fingers, ſo as to take up or keep faſt hold of any
Thing we pleaſe? Either then the Planetary Inhabitants muſt have Hands, or ſomewhat
equally convenient, which it is not eaſy to conceive; or elſe we muſt ſay that Nature
has been kinder not only to us, but even to Squirrels and Monkeys than them.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>And Feet.</i></span> That they have Feet alſo ſcarce any one can doubt, that does but conſider what we
ſaid but juſt now of Animals different Ways of going along, which it’s hard to imagine
can be perform’d any other ways than what we there recounted. And of all thoſe, there’s
none can agree ſo well with the ſtate of the Planetary Inhabitants, as that that we
here make uſe of. Except (what is not very probable, if they live in Society, as I
ſhall ſhow they do) they have found out the Art of flying in ſome of thoſe Worlds.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>That they are upright.</i></span> The Stature and Shape of Men here does ſhow forth the Divine Providence <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>ſo much in its being ſo fitly adapted to its deſign’d Uſes, that it is not without
reaſon that all the Philoſophers have taken notice of it, nor without Probability
that the Planetary Inhabitants have their Eyes and Countenance upright, like us, for
the more convenient and eaſy Contemplation and Obſervations of the Stars. For if the
Wiſdom of the Creator is ſo obſervable, ſo Praiſe-worthy in the Poſition of the other
Members; in the convenient Situation of the Eyes, as Watches in the higher Region
of the Body; in the removing of the more uncomely Parts out of ſight as ’twere, we
cannot but think he has almoſt obſerved the ſame Method in the Bodies of thoſe remote
Inhabitants. Nor <span class="marginnote"><i>It follows not therefore that they have the ſame Shape with us.</i></span> does it follow from hence that they muſt be of the ſame Shape with us. For there
is ſuch an infinite poſſible variety of Figures to be imagined, that both the Structure
of their whole Bodies, and every part of them, both outſide and inſide, may be quite
different from ours. How warmly and conveniently are ſome Creatures <span class="corr" id="xd31e913" title="Source: cloath’d">cloth’d</span> with <span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>Wool, and how finely are others decked and adorn’d with Feathers? Perhaps among the
rational Creatures in the Planets there may ſome ſuch diſtinction be obſerv’d in their
Garb and Covering; a Thing in which Beaſts ſeem to excel Men in here. Unleſs perhaps
Men are born naked, for this reaſon to put them upon employing and exerciſing their
Wits, in the inventing and making that Attire that Nature had made neceſſary for them.
And ’tis this Neceſſity that has been the greateſt, if not only occaſion of all the
Trade and Commerce, of all the Mechanical Inventions and Diſcoveries that we are Maſters
of. Beſides, Nature might have another great Conveniency in her Eye, by bringing Men
into the World naked, namely, that they might accommodate themſelves to all places
of the World, and go thicker or thinner cloth’d, according as the Seaſon and Climate
they liv’d in requir’d. There may ſtill be conceived a greater difference between
us and the Inhabitants of the Planets; for there are ſome ſort of Animals, ſuch <span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>as Oyſters, Lobſters, and Crab-fiſh, whoſe Fleſh is on the inſide of their Bones as
’twere. But that which hinders me from aſcribing ſuch a kind of Frame and Compoſition
to the Planetary Inhabitants, is that Nature ſeems to have done it only in a few of
the meaneſt Sort of Creatures, and that hereby they would be deprived of that quick
eaſy motion of their Hands and Fingers, which is ſo uſeful and <span class="corr" id="xd31e921" title="Source: neceſ-">neceſſary</span> to them, otherwiſe I ſhould not be much affected with the odd Shape and Figure.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>A rational Soul may inhabit another Shape than ours.</i></span> For ’tis a very ridiculous Opinion, that the common People have got, that ’tis impoſſible
a rational Soul ſhould dwell in any other Shape than ours. And yet as ſilly as ’tis,
it has been the occaſion of many Philoſophers allowing the Gods no other Shape; nay,
the Foundation of a Sect among the Chriſtians, that from hence have the Name of <i>Anthropomorphites</i>. This can proceed from nothing but the Weakneſs, Ignorance, and Prejudice of Men;
the ſame as that other concerning humane Shape, that it is <span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>the handſomeſt and moſt excellent of all others, when indeed it’s nothing but a being
accuſtomed to that Figure that makes us think ſo, and a Conceit that we and all other
Animals naturally have, that no Shape or Colour can be ſo good as our own. Yet ſo
powerful are theſe, that were we to meet with a Creature of a much different Shape
from Man, with Reaſon and Speech, we ſhould be much ſurpriſed and ſhocked at the Sight.
For if we try to imagine or paint a Creature like a Man in every Thing elſe, but that
has a Neck four times as long, and great round Eyes five or ſix times as big, and
farther diſtant, we cannot look upon’t without the utmoſt Averſion, altho’ at the
ſame time we can give no account of our Diſlike.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Planetarians not leſs than we.</i></span> When I juſt now mentioned the Stature of the Planetary Inhabitants, I hinted that
’twas improbable they ſhould be leſs than we are. For it’s likely, that as our Bodies
are made in ſuch a proportion to our Earth, as to render us capable of travelling
about it, and making Obſervations <span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>upon its Bulk and Figure, the ſame Order is obſerv’d in the Inhabitants of the other
Planets, unleſs in this Particular alſo, which is very conſiderable, we would prefer
our ſelves to all others. Then ſeeing we have before allow’d them Aſtronomy and Obſervations,
we muſt give them Bodies and Strength ſufficient for the ruling their Inſtruments,
and the erecting their Tubes and Engines. And for this the larger they are the better.
For if we ſhould ſuppoſe them Dwarfs not above the Bigneſs of Rats or Mice, they could
neither make ſuch Obſervations as are requiſite; nor ſuch Inſtruments as are neceſſary
to thoſe Obſervations. Therefore we muſt ſuppoſe them larger than, or at leaſt equal
to, our ſelves, eſpecially in <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i>, which are ſo vaſtly bigger than the Planet which we inhabit.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>They live in Society.</i></span> Aſtronomy, we ſaid before, could never ſubſiſt without the writing down the Obſervations:
Nor could the Art of Writing (any more than the Arts of Carpenters and Founders) ever
be found out except in a Society <span class="pageNum" id="pb79">[<a href="#pb79">79</a>]</span>of reaſonable Creatures, where the Neceſſities of Life forc’d them upon Invention:
So that it follows from hence, (as was before ſaid) that the Planetary Inhabitants
muſt in this be like us, that they maintain a Society and Fellowſhip with, and afford
mutual Aſſiſtances and Helps to one another. Hereupon we muſt allow them a ſettled,
not a wandring <i>Scythian</i> way of living, as more convenient for Men in ſuch Circumſtances. But what follows
from hence? Muſt they not have every thing elſe proper for ſuch a manner of living
granted them too? Muſt they not have their Governours, Houſes, Cities, Trade and Bartering?
Why ſhould they not, when even the barbarous People of <i>America</i> and other Places were at their firſt Diſcovery found to have ſomewhat of that nature
in uſe among them. I don’t ſay, that Things muſt be the ſame there as they are here.
We have many that may very well be ſpared among rational Creatures, and were deſign’d
only for the preſervation of Society from all Injury, and for the curbing of thoſe
<span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>Men who make an ill uſe of their Reaſon to the Detriment of others. Perhaps in the
Planets they have ſuch plenty and affluence of all good Things, as they neither need
or deſire to ſteal from one another; perhaps they may be ſo juſt and good as to be
at perpetual Peace, and never to lie in wait for, or take away the Life of their Neighbour:
perhaps they may not know what Anger or Hatred are; and if ſo, they muſt be much happier
than we. But it’s more likely they have ſuch a mixture of Good with Bad, of Wiſe with
Fools, of War with Peace, and want not that School-miſtreſs of Arts <span class="corr" id="xd31e954" title="Source: Pover-verty">Poverty</span>. For, as was before ſhown, ſome good uſe may be made of theſe things, but if not,
there is no Reaſon why we ſhould prefer their Condition to our own.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>They enjoy the Pleaſures of Society.</i></span> What I am now going to ſay may ſeem ſomewhat more bold, and yet is not leſs likely
than the former. For if theſe Nations in the Planets live in Society, as I have pretty
well ſhow’d they do, ’tis ſomewhat more than probable that they enjoy not only the
<span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>Profit, but the Pleaſures ariſing from Society: ſuch as Converſation, Amours, Jeſting,
and Shews. Otherwiſe we ſhould make them live without Diverſion or Merriment; we ſhould
deprive them of the great Sweetneſs of Life, which it can’t well be without, and give
our ſelves ſuch an Advantage over them as Reaſon will by no means admit of.
</p>
<p>But to proceed to a farther Enquiry into their Buſineſs and Employment, let’s conſider
what we have not yet mention’d, wherein they may bear any Likeneſs to us. And firſt
we have good Reaſon to believe they build themſelves Houſes, becauſe we are ſure they
are not without their Showers. For in <i>Jupiter</i> have been obſerved Clouds, big no doubt with Vapours and Water, which hath been proved
by many other Arguments, not to be wanting in that Planet. They have Rain then, for
otherwiſe how could all the Vapours drawn up by the Heat of the Sun be diſpoſed of?
And Winds, for they are cauſed only by Vapours diſſolved by Heat, and it’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>plain that they blow in <i>Jupiter</i> by the continual Motion and Variety of the <span class="marginnote"><i>They have Houſes to ſecure ’em from Weather.</i></span> Clouds about him. To protect themſelves from theſe, and that they may paſs their
Nights in Quiet and Safety, they muſt build themſelves Tents or Huts, or live in Holes
of the Earth. But why may we not ſuppoſe the Planetary Inhabitants to be as good Architects,
have as noble Houſes, and as ſtately Palaces as our ſelves? Unleſs we think that every
Thing which belongs to our ſelves is the moſt beautiful and perfect that can be. And
who are we, but a few that live in a little Corner of the World, upon a Ball ten Thouſand
times leſs than <i>Jupiter</i> or <i>Saturn</i>? And yet we muſt be the only skilful People at Building; and all others muſt be our
Inferiours in the Knowledge of uniform Symetry; and not be able to raiſe Towers and
Pyramids as high, magnificent, and beautiful, as our ſelves. For my part, I ſee no
reaſon why they may not be as great Maſters as we are, and have the Uſe of all thoſe
Arts ſubſervient to it, as Stone-cutting and Brick-making, <span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>and whatſoever elſe is neceſſary for it, as Iron, Lead and Glaſs; or ornamental to
it, as Gilding and Picture.
</p>
<p>If their Globe is divided like ours, into Sea and Land, as it’s evident it is (elſe
whence could all thoſe Vapours in <i>Jupiter</i> proceed?) we have great Reaſon to allow them the Art of Navigation, and not vainly
ingroſs ſo great, ſo uſeful a Thing to our ſelves. Eſpecially conſidering the great
Advantages <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i> have for Sailing, in having ſo many Moons to direct their Courſe, by whoſe Guidance
they may attain eaſily to the Knowledge that we are not Maſters of, of the Longitude
of Places. And what a Multitude of other Things follow from this Allowance? If they
have Ships, they muſt have Sails and Anchors, Ropes, Pullies, and Rudders, which are
of particular Uſe in directing a Ship’s Courſe againſt the Wind, and in ſailing different
Ways with the ſame Gale. And perhaps they may not be without the Uſe of the Compaſs
too, for the magnetical Matter, which continually paſſes thro’ the Pores of our Earth,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>is of ſuch a Nature, that it’s very probable the Planets have ſomething like <span class="marginnote"><i>They have Navigation, and all Arts ſubſervient.</i></span> it. But there’s no doubt but that they muſt have the Mechanical Arts and Aſtronomy,
without which Navigation can no more ſubſiſt, than they can without Geometry.
</p>
<p>But Geometry ſtands in no need of being prov’d after this manner. Nor doth it want
Aſſiſtance from other Arts which depend upon it, but we may have a nearer and ſhorter
Aſſurance of their not being without it in thoſe Earths. For that Science is of ſuch
ſingular Worth and Dignity, ſo peculiarly imploys the Underſtanding, and gives it
ſuch a full Comprehenſion and infallible <span class="marginnote"><i>As Geometry.</i></span> certainty of Truth, as no other Knowledge can pretend to: it is moreover of ſuch
a Nature, that its Principles and Foundations muſt be ſo immutably the ſame in all
Times and Places, that we cannot without Injuſtice pretend to monopolize it, and rob
the reſt of the Univerſe of ſuch an incomparable Study. Nay Nature it ſelf invites
us to be Geometricians; it preſents us with Geometrical <span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>Figures, with Circles and Squares, with Triangles, Polygones, and Spheres, and propoſes
them as it were to our Conſideration and Study, which abſtracting from its Uſefulneſs,
is moſt delightful and raviſhing. Who can read <i>Euclid</i>, or <i>Apollonius</i>, about the Circle, without Admiration? Or <i>Archimedes</i> of the Surface of the Sphere, and Quadrature of the Parabola without Amazement? or
conſider the late ingenious Diſcoveries of the Moderns with Boldneſs and Unconcernedneſs?
And all theſe Truths are as naked and open, and depend upon the ſame plain Principles
and Axioms in <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i> as here, which makes it not improbable that there are in the Planets ſome who partake
with us in theſe delightful and pleaſant Studies. But what’s the greateſt Argument
with me, that there are ſuch, is their Uſe, I had almoſt ſaid Neceſſity, in moſt Affairs
of humane Life. Now we are got thus far, what if we ſhould venture ſomewhat farther,
and ſay, that they have our Inventions of the Tables of Sines, of Logarithms, and
<span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>Algebra? I know it would ſound very odd, and perhaps a little ridiculous, and yet
there’s no reaſon but the thinking our ſelves better than all the World, to hinder
them from being as happy in their Diſcoveries, and as ingenious in their Inventions
as we our ſelves are.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>They have Muſick.</i></span> It’s the ſame with Muſick as with Geometry, it’s every where immutably the ſame,
and always will be ſo. For all Harmony conſiſts in Concord, and Concord is all the
World over fix’d according to the ſame invariable Meaſure and Proportion. So that
in all Nations the Difference and Diſtance of Notes is the ſame, whether they be in
a continued gradual Progreſſion, or the Voice makes skips over one to the next. Nay
very credible Authors report, that there’s a ſort of Bird in <i>America</i>, that can plainly ſing in order ſix muſical Notes: Whence it follows, that the Laws
of Muſick are unchangeably fix’d by Nature, and therefore the ſame Reaſon holds for
their Muſick, as we e’en now ſhewed for their Geometry. For why, ſuppoſing other <span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>Nations and Creatures, endued with Reaſon and Senſe as well as we, ſhould not they
reap the Pleaſures ariſing from theſe Senſes as well as we too? I don’t know what
Effect this Argument, from the immutable Nature of theſe Arts, may have upon the Minds
of others; I think it no inconſiderable or contemptible one, but of as great Strength
as that which I made uſe of above to prove that the Planetary Inhabitants had the
Senſe of Seeing.
</p>
<p>But if they take delight in Harmony, there is no doubt but that they have invented
Muſical Inſtruments. For they could ſcarce help lighting upon ſome or other by chance;
the Sound of a tight String, the Noiſe of the Winds, or the whiſtling of Reeds, might
have given them the hint. From theſe ſmall Beginnings they perhaps, as well as we,
have advanced by degrees to the Uſe of the Lute, Harp, Flute, and many ſtring’d Inſtruments.
But altho’ the Tones are certain and determinate, yet we find among different Nations
a quite different manner and rule for Singing; as <span class="pageNum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>formerly among the <i>Dorians</i>, <i>Phrygians</i>, and <i>Lydians</i>, and in our Time among the <i>French</i>, <i>Italians</i>, and <i>Perſians</i>. In like manner it may ſo happen, that the Muſick of the Inhabitants of the Planets
may widely differ from all theſe, and yet be very good. But why we ſhould look upon
their Muſick to be worſe than ours, there’s no reaſon can be given; neither can we
well preſume that they want the Uſe of Halſ-Notes and Quarter-Notes, ſeeing the Invention
of Halſ-Notes is ſo obvious, and the Uſe of them ſo agreeable to Nature. Nay, to go
a Step farther, what if they ſhould excel us in the Theory and practick part of Muſick,
and outdo us in Conſorts of vocal and inſtrumental Muſick, ſo artificially compos’d,
that they ſhew their Skill by the Mixtures of Diſcords and Concords? and of this laſt
ſort ’tis very likely the 5th and 3d are in uſe with them.
</p>
<p>This is a very bold Aſſertion, but it may be true for ought we know, and the Inhabitants
of the Planets may poſſibly have a greater inſight into the Theory of Muſick than
has yet been <span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>diſcover’d among us. For if you ask any of our Muſicians, why two or more perfect
Fifths cannot be uſed regularly in Compoſition; ſome ſay ’tis to avoid that Sweetneſs
and Luſhiouſneſs which ariſes from the Repetition of this pleaſing Chord. Others ſay,
this muſt be avoided for the ſake of that Variety of Chords that are requiſite to
make a good Compoſition; and theſe Reaſons are brought by <i>Cartes</i> and others. But an Inhabitant of <i>Jupiter</i> or <i>Venus</i> will perhaps give you a better Reaſon for this, <i>viz.</i> becauſe when you paſs from one perfect Fifth to another, there is ſuch a Change made
as immediately alters your Key, you are got into a new Key before the Ear is prepared
for it, and the more perfect Chords you uſe of the ſame kind in Conſecution, by ſo
much the more you offend the Ear by theſe abrupt Changes.
</p>
<p>Again, one of theſe Inhabitants perhaps can ſhow how it comes about, that in a Song
of one or more Parts, the Key cannot be kept ſo well in the ſame agreeable Tenour,
unleſs the intermediate Cloſes and Intervals be ſo temper’d, <span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>as to vary from their uſual Proportions, and thereby to bear a little this way or
that, in order to regulate the Scale. And why this Temperature is beſt in the Syſtem
of the Strings, when out of the Fifth the fourth Part of a Comma is uſually cut off;
This ſame thing I have formerly ſhew’d at large.
</p>
<p>But for the regulating the Tone of the Voice (as I before hinted) that may admit of
a more eaſy proof, and we ſhall give you an Eſſay of it, ſince I have mentioned a
thing that is not mere Imagination only: I ſay therefore, if any Perſon ſtrike thoſe
Sounds which the Muſicians diſtinguiſh by theſe Letters, C, F, D, G, C, by theſe agreeable
Intervals, altogether perfect, interchangeable, aſcending and deſcending with the
Voice: Now this latter ſound C will be one Comma, or very ſmall portion lower than
the firſt ſounding of C. Becauſe of theſe perfect Intervals, which are as 4 to 3,
5 to 6, 4 to 3, 2 to 3, an account is made in ſuch a Proportion, as 160 to 162. that
is, as 80 to 81, which is what they call a Comma. So that if the ſame Sound <span class="pageNum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>ſhould be repeated nine times, the Voice would fall near the Matter a greater Tone,
whoſe proportion is as 8 to 9. But this the Senſe of the Ears by no means endures,
but remembers the firſt Tone, and returns to it again. Therefore we are compell’d
to uſe an occult Temperament, and to ſing theſe imperfect Intervals, from doing which
leſs Offence ariſes. And for the moſt part, all Singing wants this Temperament, as
may be collected by the aforeſaid Computations. And theſe things we have offer’d to
thoſe that have ſome Knowledge in Geometry.
</p>
<p>We have ſpoke of theſe Arts and Inventions, which it is very probable the Inhabitants
of the Planets partake of in common with us, beſides which it ſeems requiſite to take
in many other Things that ſerve either for the Uſe or Pleaſure of their Lives. But
what theſe Things are we ſhall the better account for, by laying before us many of
thoſe Things which are found among us. I have before mention’d the Variety of Animals
and Vegetables, which very much differ from each other, <span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>among which there are ſome that differ but little; and I have ſaid, that there are
no leſs differences in theſe Things in the Planetary Worlds.
</p>
<p>I ſhall now take a ſhort view of the Benefits we receive both from thoſe Herbs and
Animals, and ſee whether we may not with very good reaſon conclude that the Planetary
Inhabitants reap as great and as many from thoſe that their Countries afford them.
</p>
<p>And here it may be worth our while to take a Review of the Variety and Multitude of
our Riches. For Trees and Herbs do not only ſerve us for Food, they in their delicious
Fruits, theſe in their Seeds, Leaves and Roots; but Herbs moreover furniſh us with
Phyſick, and Trees with Timber for our Houſes and Ships. Flax, by the means of thoſe
two uſeful Arts of Spinning and Weaving, affords us Clothing. Of Hemp or Matweed we
twiſt our ſelves Thread and ſmall Ropes, the former of which we employ in Sails and
Nets, the latter in making larger Ropes for Maſts and Anchors. With the ſweet Smells
and <span class="pageNum" id="pb93">[<a href="#pb93">93</a>]</span><span class="marginnote"><i>The Advantages we reap from Herbs and Animals.</i></span> beauteous Colours of Flowers we feaſt our Senſes: and even thoſe of them, that offend
our Noſtrils, or are miſchievous to our Bodies, are ſeldom without excellent Uſes:
or were made perhaps by Nature as a Foil to ſet off, and make us the more value the
Good by comparing them with theſe. What vaſt Advantages and Profit do we reap from
the Animals? The Sheep give us Clothing, and the Cows afford us Milk: and both of
them their Fleſh for our Suſtenance. Aſſes, Camels, and Horſes do, what if we wanted
them we muſt do our ſelves, carry our Burdens; and the laſt of them we make uſe of,
either themſelves to carry us, or in our Coaches to draw us. In which we have ſo excellent,
ſo uſeful an Invention of Wheels, that I can’t ſuppoſe the Planets to enjoy Society
and all its Conſequences, and be without them. Whether they are Pythagoreans there,
or feed upon Fleſh as we do, I dare not affirm any Thing. Tho’ it ſeems to be allowed
Men to feed upon whatſoever may afford them Nouriſhment, either on Land, or in <span class="pageNum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>Water, upon Herbs, and Pomes, Milk, Eggs, Honey, Fiſh, and no leſs upon the Fleſh
of many Birds and Beaſts. But it is a ſurpriſing thing! that a rational Creature ſhould
live upon the Ruin and Deſtruction of ſuch a number of other his Fellow-Creatures!
And yet it does not ſeem at all unnatural, ſince not only he, but even Lions, Wolves,
and other ravenous Beaſts, prey upon Flocks of other harmleſs Things, and make mere
Fodder of them; as Eagles do of Pidgeons and Hares; and large Fiſh of the helpleſs
little ones. We have different ſorts of Dogs for Hunting, and what our own Legs cannot,
that their Noſe and Legs can help us to. But the Uſe and Profit of Herbs and Animals
are not the only Things they are good for, but they raiſe our Delight and Admiration
when we conſider their various Forms and Natures, and enquire into all their different
ways of Generation: Things ſo infinitely multifarious, and ſo delightfully amazing,
that the Books of natural Philoſophers are deſervedly filled with their Encomiums.
For even in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>very Inſects, who can but admire the ſix-corner’d Cells of the Bees, or the artificial
Web of a Spider, or the fine Bag of a Silk-worm, which laſt affords us, with the Help
of incredible Induſtry, even Shiploads of ſoft delicate Clothing. This is a ſhort
Summary of thoſe many profitable Advantages the animal and herbal World ſerve us with.
</p>
<p>But this is not all. The Bowels of the Earth likewiſe contribute much to Man’s Happineſs.
For what Art and Cunning does he employ in finding, in digging, in trying Metals,
and in melting, refining, and tempering them? <span class="marginnote"><i>And from Metals.</i></span> What Skill and Nicety in beating, drawing or diſſolving Gold, ſo as with inconſiderable
Changes to make every Thing he pleaſes put on that noble Luſtre? Of how many and admirable
Uſes is Iron? and how ignorant in all Mechanical Knowledge were thoſe Nations that
were not acquainted with it, ſo as to have no other Arms but Bows, Clubs, and Spears,
made of Wood. There’s one Thing indeed we have, which it’s a Queſtion whether it has
<span class="pageNum" id="pb96">[<a href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>done more harm or good, and that is Gun-powder made of Nitre and Brimſtone. At firſt
indeed it ſeem’d as if we had got a more ſecure Defenſe than former Ages againſt all
Aſſaults, and could eaſily guard our Towns, by the wonderful Strength of that Invention,
againſt all hoſtile Invaſions: but now we find it has rather encouraged them, and
at the ſame time been no ſmall Occaſion of the Decay of Valour, by rendring it and
Strength almoſt uſeleſs in War. Had the <i>Grecian</i> Emperor who ſaid, <i>Virtue was ruin’d</i> only when Slings and Rams firſt came into uſe, liv’d in our Days, he might well have
complain’d; eſpecially of Bombs, againſt which neither Art nor Nature is of ſufficient
Proof: but which lays every Thing, Caſtles and Towers, be they never ſo ſtrong, even
with the Ground. If for nothing elſe, yet upon this one account, I think we had better
have been without the Diſcovery. Yet, when we were talking of our Diſcoveries, it
was not to be paſs’d over, for the Planets too may have their miſchievous as well
as uſeful Inventions.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>We are happier in the Uſes for which the Air and Water ſerves us; both of which helps
us in our Navigation, and furniſhes us with a Strength ſufficient, without any Labour
of our own, to turn round our Mills and Engines; Things which are of uſe to us in
ſo many different Employments. For with them we grind our Corn, and ſqueeze out our
Oil; with them we cut Wood, and mill Cloth, and with them we beat our Stuff for Paper.
An incomparable Invention! Where the naſtieſt uſeleſs Scraps of Linen are made to
produce fine white Sheets. To theſe we may add the late diſcovery of Printing, which
not only preſerves from Death Arts and Knowledge, but makes them much eaſier to be
attained than before. Nor muſt we forget the Arts of Engraving and Painting, which
from mean Beginnings have improved to that Excellence, that nothing that ever ſprung
from the Wit of Man can claim Pre-eminence to them. Nor is the way of melting and
blowing Glaſſes, and of poliſhing and ſpreading Quick-ſilver <span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>over Looking-Glaſſes, unworthy of being mentioned, nor above all, the admirable uſes
that Glaſſes have been put to in natural Knowledge, ſince the Invention of the Teleſcope
and Microſcope. And no leſs nice and fine is the Art of making Clocks, ſome of which
are ſo ſmall as to be no weight to the Bearer; and others ſo exact as to meaſure out
the Time in as ſmall Portions as any one can deſire: the Improvement of both which
the World owes to my <a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1091src" href="#xd31e1091">1</a>Inventions.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>From the diſcoveries of our Age.</i></span> I might add much here of the late Diſcoveries, moſt of them of this Age, which have
been made in all ſorts of Natural Knowledge as well as in Geometry and Aſtronomy,
as of the Weight and Spring of the Air, of the Chymical Experiments that have ſhown
us a way of making Liquors that ſhall ſhine in the Dark, and with gentle moving ſhall
burn of themſelves. I might mention the Circulation of the Blood through the Veins
and Arteries, which was underſtood indeed before; but now, by the help of the Microſcope,
has an ocular demonſtration <span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>in the Tails of ſome Fiſhes: of the Generation of Animals, which now is found to be
performed no otherwiſe than by the Seed of one of the ſame kind; and that in the Seed
of the Male are diſcover’d, by the help of Glaſſes, Millions of ſprightly little Animals,
which it’s probable are the very Offspring of the Animals themſelves: a ſurpriſing
thing, and never before now known!
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Planets have, tho’ not theſe ſame, yet as uſeful Inventions.</i></span> Thus have I put together all theſe late Diſcoveries of our Earth: and now, tho’ perhaps
ſome of them may be common to the Planetary Inhabitants with us, yet that they ſhould
have all of them is not credible. But then they may have ſomewhat to make up that
Defect, others as good and as uſeful, and as wonderful, that we want. We have allow’d
that they may have rational Creatures among them, and Geometricians, and Muſicians:
We have prov’d that they live in Societies, have Hands and Feet, are guarded with
Houſes and Walls: Wherefore if a Man could be carried thither by ſome powerful Genius,
ſome <i>Mercury</i>, I don’t <span class="pageNum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>doubt ’twould be a very curious ſight, curious beyond all Imagination, to ſee the
odd ways, and the unuſual manner of their ſetting about any thing, and their ſtrange
methods of living. But ſince there’s no hopes of our going ſuch a Journey, we muſt
be contented with what’s in our Power: we may ſuppoſe our ſelves there, and inquire
as far as we can into the Aſtronomy of each Planet, and ſee in what manner the Heavens
preſent themſelves to their Inhabitants. We ſhall make ſome Obſervations of the Eminence
of each of them, in reſpect of their Magnitude, and number of Moons they have to wait
on them; and ſhall propoſe a new Method of coming to ſome Knowledge of the incredible
diſtance of the ſix’d Stars. But firſt after this long and deep Thoughtfulneſs we
will give our ſelves a little Reſt, and ſo put an end to this Book.

<p class="first">’Twas a pretty many Years ago that I chanc’d to light upon <i>Athanaſius Kircher</i>’s Book, call’d <i>The Ecſtatick Journey</i>, which treats of the nature of the Stars, and of the Things that are to be found
in the Superficies of the Planets: I wondered to ſee nothing there of what I had often
thought not improbable, but quite other Things, nothing but a Heap of idle unreaſonable
Stuff: which I was the more confirm’d in, when, after the writing of the former part,
I ran over the Book again. And I thought mine were very conſiderable and weighty Matters
if compar’d with <i>Kircher</i>’s. That other People may be ſatisfied in this, and ſee how vainly thoſe, who caſt
off the only Foundations of Probability in ſuch Matters, which we have all the way
made uſe of, pretend to philoſophize <span class="pageNum" id="pb102">[<a href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>in this caſe, I think it will not be beſide the Purpoſe to beſtow ſome few Reflections
upon that Book.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Kircher<i>’s Journey in Ecſtacy examin’d</i>.</span> That ingenious Man ſuppoſing himſelf carried by ſome Angel thro’ the vaſt Spaces
of Heaven, and round the Stars, tells us, he ſaw a great many things, ſome of which
he had out of the Books of Aſtronomers, the reſt are the Product of his own Fancy
and Thoughts. But, before he enters upon his Journey, he lays down theſe two Things
as certain; that no Motion muſt be allowed the Earth, and that God has made nothing
in the Planets, no not ſo much as Herbs, which has either Life or Senſe in it. Leaving
then the Syſtem of <i>Copernicus</i>, he chuſes <i>Tycho</i> for his Guide. But when he ſuppoſes all the fix’d Stars to be Suns, and round each
of them places their Planets, here (againſt his Will I ſuppoſe) he has unawares made
an infinite number of <i>Copernican</i> Syſtems. All which, beſide their own Motion, he abſurdly makes to be carried, with
an incredible ſwiftneſs, in twenty four Hours round the Earth. Since moſt <span class="pageNum" id="pb103">[<a href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>of theſe Worlds are out of the Reach of any Man’s ſight, as he owns they are, I cannot
think for what purpoſe he makes ſo many Suns to ſhine upon deſolate Lands (like our
Earth in every thing, he ſays, only that they have neither Plants nor Animals) where
there’s no one to whom they ſhould give light. And from hence he ſtill falls into
more and more Abſurdities. And becauſe he could find no other uſe of the Planets,
even in our Syſtem, he is forc’d to beg Help of the Aſtrologers; and would have all
thoſe vaſt Bodies made upon no other account than that the whole Univerſe might be
preſerved and continue ſecure by their means, and that they might govern the Mind
of Man by their various and regular Influences. Accordingly, to gratify Aſtrology,
he ſays that <i>Venus</i> was the moſt pleaſant Place, every thing fine and handſome, its Light gentle, its
Waters ſweet and purling, and it ſelf beſet all about with ſhining Chryſtals. In <i>Jupiter</i> he found wholeſome and ſweet Gales, delicate Waters, and a Land ſhining like Silver.
For from <span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>theſe two Planets it ſeems, Men have all that is happy and healthful poured down upon
them; and all that renders them handſome and lovely, wiſe and grave, is owing to their
Influences. <i>Mercury</i> had I don’t know what Airineſs and Briskneſs in it; whence Men derive, when they
are firſt born, all their Wit and Cunning. <i>Mars</i> was nothing but infernal, ſtinking, black Flames and Smoke: and <i>Saturn</i> was all melancholy, dreadful, naſty, and dark: for theſe are the Planets (I don’t
know why, but all Fortune-tellers hate them) that bring all the Plagues and Miſchiefs
that we feel upon us, and would exerciſe their Spite ſtill more, unleſs they were
ſometimes mitigated and corrected by the benign and kind Influences of the other Planets.
All this and ſuch like Stuff his Genius teaches him. Which he makes give a ſerious
Anſwer to this idle Queſtion, Whether a Jew or Heathen could be duly and rightly baptized
in the Waters of <i>Venus</i>? Of him too he learns that the Heaven of the fix’d Stars is not made of ſolid Matter,
but of a thin fluid, <span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>wherein an innumerable company of Stars and Suns lie floating here and there, not
chain’d down to any Place, (thus far he’s in the right) and deſcribing in the Space
of a Day theſe prodigious Circles round the Earth. He forgets here, if there were
ſuch a Motion, with what an incredible ſwiftneſs they would fly off from every part
of their Orbits. But I ſuppoſe the Intelligences that he has plac’d in them are to
take care of that, thoſe Angels that preſide over, and regulate their Motions. And
in that he follows a company of Doctors that harbour’d that idle fancy of <i>Ariſtotle</i> upon no Account or Conſideration. But <i>Copernicus</i> has freed thoſe Intelligences of all that Labour and Trouble, only by bringing in
the Motion of the Earth: which, if upon no other Account, every one that is not blind
purpoſely, muſt own to be neceſſary upon this. I dare ſay <i>Kircher</i>, if he had dar’d freely to ſpeak his Mind, could have afforded us better ſort of
Things than theſe. But when he could not have that liberty, I think he might as well
have <span class="pageNum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>let the whole Matter alone. But enough of this; let’s have have done with this famous
Author: And now that we have ventur’d to place Spectators in the Planets, let us examine
each of them, and ſee what their Years, Days, and Aſtronomy are.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Syſtem of the Planets in</i> Mercury.</span> To begin with the innermoſt and neareſt the Sun: We know that <i>Mercury</i> is three times nearer that vaſt Body of Light than we are. Whence it follows that
they ſee him three times bigger, and feel him nine times hotter than we do. Such a
degree of Heat would be intolerable to us, and ſet afire all our dry’d Herbs, our
Hay and Straw that we uſe. And yet there is no doubt but that the Animals there, are
made of ſuch a Temper, as to be but moderately warm, and the Plants ſuch as to be
able to endure the Heat. The Inhabitants of <i>Mercury</i>, it’s likely, have the ſame opinion of us that we have of <i>Saturn</i>, that we muſt be <span class="corr" id="xd31e1177" title="Source: intollerably">intolerably</span> cold, and have little or no Light, we are ſo far from the Sun. There’s reaſon to
doubt, whether the Inhabitants of <i>Mercury</i>, tho’ they live ſo much nearer <span class="pageNum" id="pb107">[<a href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>the Sun, the Fountain of Life and Vigour, are much more airy and ingenious than we.
For if we may gueſs at them by what we ſee here, we ſhall not be obliged to grant
it. The Inhabitants of <i>Africa</i> and <i>Braſil</i>, that have got for their Share the hotteſt Places in the Earth, being neither ſo
wiſe nor ſo induſtrious as thoſe that belong to colder and more temperate Climates;
they have ſcarce any Arts or Knowledge among them; and thoſe of them that live upon
the very Shore, underſtand little or no Navigation. Nor can I be willing to make all
that vaſt number that muſt inhabit thoſe two large Planets, <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i>, and have ſuch noble Attendance, mere dull Blockheads, or without as much Wit as
our ſelves, tho’ they are ſo far more diſtant from the Sun. The Aſtronomy of thoſe
that live in <i>Mercury</i>, and the appearance of the Planets to them, oppoſite at certain times to the Sun,
may be eaſily conceived by the Scheme of the <i>Copernican</i> Syſtem in the former Part. At the times of theſe Oppoſitions <i>Venus</i> and the Earth muſt needs <span class="pageNum" id="pb108">[<a href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>appear very bright and large to them. For if <i>Venus</i> ſhines ſo gloriouſly to us when ſhe is new and horned, ſhe muſt neceſſarily in oppoſition
to the Sun, when ſhe is full, be at leaſt ſix or ſeven times larger, and a great deal
nearer to the Inhabitants of <i>Mercury</i>, and afford them Light ſo ſtrong and bright, that they have no reaſon to complain
of their want of a Moon. What the Length of their Days are, or whether they have different
Seaſons in the Year, is not yet diſcovered, becauſe we have not yet been able to obſerve
whether his Axis have any inclination to his Orbit, or what Time he ſpends in his
diurnal Revolution about his own Axis. And yet ſeeing <i>Mars</i>, the Earth, <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i>, have certainly ſuch Succeſſions, there’s no reaſon to doubt but that he has his
Days and Nights as well as they. But his Year is ſcarce the fourth part ſo long as
ours.
</p>
<p>The Inhabitants of <i>Venus</i> have much the ſame Face of Things as thoſe in <i>Mercury</i>, only they never ſee him in oppoſition to the Sun, which is occaſioned <span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>by his never removing above 38 degrees, or thereabouts, from it. The Sun appears to
them larger by half in his Diameter, and above twice in his Circumference, than to
us: and by conſequence affords them but twice as much Light and Heat, ſo that they
are nearer our Temperature than <i>Mercury</i>. Their Year is compleated in ſeven and a half of our Months. In the Night our Earth,
when ’tis on the other ſide of the Sun from <i>Venus</i>, muſt needs ſeem much larger and lighter to <i>Venus</i> than ſhe doth ever to us; and then they may eaſily ſee, if their Eyes be not weaker
than ours, our conſtant Attendant the Moon. I have often wonder’d that when I have
view’d <i>Venus</i> when ſhe is neareſt to the Earth, and reſembled an Half-moon, juſt beginning to have
ſomething like Horns, through a Teleſcope of 45 or 60 Foot long, ſhe always appeared
to me all over equally lucid, that I can’t ſay I obſerved ſo much as one Spot in her,
tho’ in <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Mars</i>, which ſeem much leſs to us, they are very plainly perceiv’d. <span class="pageNum" id="pb110">[<a href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>For if <i>Venus</i> had any ſuch Thing as Sea and Land, the former muſt neceſſarily ſhow much more obſcure
than the other, as anyone may ſatisfy himſelf, that from a very high Mountain will
but look down upon our Earth. I thought that perhaps the too brisk Light of <i>Venus</i> might be the occaſion of this equal appearance; but when I uſed an Eye-glaſs that
was ſmok’d for the Purpoſe, it was ſtill the ſame Thing. What then, has <i>Venus</i> no Sea, or do the Waters there reflect the Light more than ours do, or their Land
leſs? Or rather (which is moſt probable in my Opinion) is not all that Light we ſee
reflected from an Atmoſphere ſurrounding <i>Venus</i>, which being thicker and more ſolid than that in <i>Mars</i> or <i>Jupiter</i>, hinders our ſeeing any thing of the Globe it ſelf, and is at the ſame time capable
of ſending back the Rays that it receives from the Sun? For it is certain that if
we looked on the Earth from the outſide of the Atmoſphere, we ſhould not perceive
ſuch a difference as we do from a Mountain; but by reaſon of the interpoſed <span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>Atmoſphere, we ſhould obſerve very little Diſparity between Sea and Land. ’Tis the
ſame Thing that hinders us from ſeeing the Spots in the Moon as plain in the Day as
in the Night, becauſe the Vapours that ſurround the Earth being then <span class="corr" id="xd31e1252" title="Source: enlightned">enlighten’d</span> by the Rays of the Sun, are an Impediment to our Proſpect.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>In</i> Mars.</span> But <i>Mars</i>, as I ſaid before, has ſome Parts of him darker than other ſome. By the conſtant
Returns of which his Nights and Days have been found to be of about the ſame length
with ours. But the Inhabitants have no perceivable Difference between Summer and Winter,
the Axis of that Planet having very little or no Inclination to his Orbit, as has
been diſcover’d by the Motion of his Spots. Our Earth muſt appear to them almoſt as
<i>Venus</i> doth to us, and by the Help of a Teleſcope will be found to have its Wane, Increaſe,
and Full, like the Moon: and never to remove from the Sun above 48 Degrees, by whoſe
Diſcovery they ſee it, as well as <i>Mercury</i> and <i>Venus</i>, ſometimes paſs over the Sun’s Disk. They as ſeldom ſee <span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span><i>Venus</i> as we do <i>Mercury</i>. I am apt to believe, that the Land in <i>Mars</i> is of a blacker Colour than that of <i>Jupiter</i> or the Moon, which is the reaſon of his appearing of a Copper Colour, and his reflecting
a weaker Light than is proportionable to his diſtance from the Sun. His Body, as I
obſerved before, tho’ farther from the Sun, is leſs than <i>Venus</i>. Nor has he any Moon to wait upon him, and in that, as well as <i>Mercury</i> and <i>Venus</i>, he muſt be acknowledged inferiour to the Earth. His Light and Heat is twice, and
ſometimes three times leſs than ours, to which I ſuppoſe the Conſtitution of his Inhabitants
is anſwerable.

</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Jupiter <i>and</i> Saturn <i>the moſt eminent of the Planets both for bigneſs and attendants</i>.</span> If our Earth can claim pre-eminence of the fore-mention’d Planets, for having a Moon
to attend upon it, (for its Magnitude can make but a ſmall difference) how much Superiour
muſt <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i> be to thoſe three and the Earth alſo? For whether we conſider their Bulk, in which
they far exceed all the others, or the Number of Moons that wait upon them, it’s very
probable that they are the chief, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb113">[<a href="#pb113">113</a>]</span>primary Planets in our Syſtem, in compariſon with which the other four are nothing,
and ſcarce worth mentioning. For the eaſier Conception of their vaſt Diſparity, I
have thought fit to add a Scheme of our Earth, with the Moon’s Orbit, and the Globe
of the Moon itſelf, and the Syſtems of <span class="marginnote"><i>Fig. 3.</i></span> <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i>, where I have drawn every thing as near the true Proportion as poſſible. <i>Jupiter</i> you ſee is adorned with four, and <i>Saturn</i> with five Moons, all placed in their reſpective Orbits. The Moons about <i>Jupiter</i> we owe to <i>Galilæo</i>, ’tis well known: and any one may imagine he was in no ſmall Rapture at the Diſcovery.
The outermoſt but one, and brighteſt of <i>Saturn</i>’s, it chanc’d to be my lot, with a Teleſcope not above 12 foot long, to have the
firſt ſight of in the Year 1655. The reſt we may thank the induſtrious <i>Caſſini</i> for, who uſed the Glaſſes of <i>Joſ. Campanus</i>’s grinding, firſt of 36, and afterwards of 136 foot long. He has often, and particularly
in the Year 1672, ſhew’d me the Third and Fifth. The Firſt and Second he gave <span class="pageNum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span>me notice of by Letters in the Year 1684; but they are ſcarce ever to be ſeen, and
I can’t poſitively ſay, I had ever that Happineſs; but am as ſatisfied that they are
there, as if I had; not in the leaſt ſuſpecting the Credit of that worthy Man. Nay,
I am afraid there are One or Two more ſtill behind, and not without reaſon. For between
the Fourth and Fifth there’s a Diſtance not at all proportionable to that between
all the others: Here, for ought I know, there may be a Sixth; or perhaps there may
be <span class="corr" id="xd31e1333" title="Source: anothet">another</span> without the Fifth that may yet have eſcaped us: for we can never ſee the Fifth but
in that part of his Orbit, which is towards the Weſt: for which we ſhall give you
a very good reaſon.
</p>
<p>Perhaps when <i>Saturn</i> comes into the Northern Signs, and is at a good height from the Horizon (for at the
writing of this he is at his loweſt) you may happen to make ſome new Diſcoveries,
good Brother, if you would but make uſe of your two Teleſcopes of 170 and 210 Foot
long; the longeſt, and the beſt I believe now <span class="pageNum" id="pb115">[<a href="#pb115">115</a>]</span>in the World. For tho’ we have not yet had an opportunity of obſerving the Heavens
with them (as well by reaſon of their <span class="corr" id="xd31e1342" title="Source: Unweildineſs">Unwieldineſs</span>, as for the Interruption of our Studies by your Abſence) yet I am ſatisfied of their
Goodneſs by our trial of them one Night, in reading a Letter at a vaſt diſtance by
the Help of a Light. I cannot but think of thoſe times with Pleaſure, and of our diverting
Labour in poliſhing and preparing ſuch Glaſſes, in inventing new Methods and Engines,
and always puſhing forward to ſtill greater and greater Things. But to return to the
Figures, of which there remains ſomething further to be ſaid.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The proportion of the Diameter of</i> Jupiter, <i>and of the Orbs of his</i> Satellites, <i>to the Orbit of the Moon round the Earth</i>.</span> I have there made the Diameter of <i>Jupiter</i> about two third parts of our diſtance from the Moon: for the Diameter of <i>Jupiter</i> is above twenty times bigger than that of the Earth; which is about a thirtieth part
of the Moon’s diſtance. The Orbit of the outermoſt of <i>Jupiter</i>’s Satellites is to that of the Moon round the Earth, as 8 and ½ is to 1. And each
of theſe Moons, by the Shadow they make upon <i>Jupiter</i>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb116">[<a href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>cannot be leſs than our Earth. Their <span class="marginnote"><i>The Periods of</i> Jupiter<i>’s Moons</i>.</span> Periods, that I may not omit them, are according to <i>Caſſini</i>’s Account theſe. That of the inmoſt is one day, 18 hours, 28 minutes, and 36 ſeconds.
The Second ſpends 3 days, 13 hours, 13 min.<span class="corr" id="xd31e1373" title="Not in source">,</span> 52 ſeconds in going round him. The Third 7 days, 3 hours, 59 min.<span class="corr" id="xd31e1375" title="Not in source">,</span> 40 ſec. The Fourth 16 days, 18 hours, 5 min.<span class="corr" id="xd31e1377" title="Not in source">,</span> 6 ſec. The Diſtance of the innermoſt from <i>Jupiter</i> himſelf is 2⅚ of his Diameters. That of the Second is 4 and a half: Of the Third
7 and one ſixth part: Of the Fourth 12 and two thirds, of the ſame <span class="marginnote"><i>And</i> Saturn<i>’s</i>.</span> Diameters. The Innermoſt of <i>Saturn</i>’s Satellites moves round him in 1 day, 21 hours, 18 min.<span class="corr" id="xd31e1390" title="Not in source">,</span> 31 ſec. The Second in 2 days, 17 hours, 41 min.<span class="corr" id="xd31e1392" title="Not in source">,</span> 27 ſec. The Third in 4 days, 13 hours, 47 min.<span class="corr" id="xd31e1394" title="Not in source">,</span> 16 ſec. The Fourth in 15 days, 22 hours, 41 min.<span class="corr" id="xd31e1396" title="Not in source">,</span> 11 ſec. The Fifth in 79 days, 7 hours, 53 min.<span class="corr" id="xd31e1399" title="Not in source">,</span> 57 ſec. Their Diſtances from the Center of <i>Saturn</i> are, that of the firſt almoſt one, that is 39 fortieth parts of the Diameter of his
Ring; that of the ſecond one and a quarter of thoſe Diameters; <span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>of the third one and three quarters of them; of the fourth four, or according to my
Calculation, but 3 and a half; of the 5th 12, which were found with vaſt Pains and
Labour.
</p>
<p>Now can any one look upon, and compare theſe Syſtems together, without being amazed
at the vaſt Magnitude and noble Attendance of theſe two Planets, in reſpect of this
little Earth of ours? Or can they force themſelves to think, that the wiſe Creator
has diſpoſed of all his Animals and Plants here, has furniſh’d and adorn’d this Spot
only, and has left all thoſe Worlds bare and deſtitute of Inhabitants, who might adore
and worſhip him; or that all thoſe prodigious Bodies were made only to twinkle to,
and be ſtudied by ſome few perhaps of us poor Mortals?
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>This proportion true according to all modern Obſervations.</i></span> I do not doubt but there will be ſome who will think we are very much miſtaken about
the Magnitude of theſe Planets. For will you pretend to make them who are taken up
in admiring the Largeneſs of this Globe, <span class="pageNum" id="pb118">[<a href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>its multitude of Nations, Cities, and Empires; can you pretend I ſay to make them
ever believe that there are Places in compariſon of which the Earth is as inconſiderable
as this Figure would make it? But they ought to be inform’d, that theſe Proportions
are thoſe which the beſt Aſtronomers of this Age have agreed upon. For if the Earth
be diſtant from the Sun ten or eleven thouſand of its own Diameters, according to
the Accounts of Monſieur <i>Caſſini</i> in <i>France</i>, and Mr. <i>Flamſted</i> in <i>England</i>, wherein they made uſe of very exact Obſervations of the Parallaxes of <i>Mars</i>; or if, according to a very probable Conjecture of mine, it be diſtant twelve thouſand,
then the Magnitudes of the other Orbs will very near anſwer the Proportions here ſettled.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The apparent magnitude of the Sun in</i> Jupiter, <i>and a way of finding what Light they there enjoy</i>.</span> But to return to <i>Jupiter</i>. The Sun appears to them who are upon it five times leſs than to us, and conſequently
they have but the five and twentieth part of the Light and Heat that we receive from
it. But that Light is not ſo weak as we imagine, as is <span class="pageNum" id="pb119">[<a href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>plain by the Brightneſs of that Planet in the Night; and alſo from hence, that when
the Sun is ſo far eclipſed to us, as that only the 25th part of his Disk remains uncovered,
he is not ſenſibly darken’d. But if you have a mind exactly to know the Quantity of
Light that <i>Jupiter</i> enjoys, you may take a Tube of what Length you pleaſe. Let one end of it be cloſed
with a Plate of Braſs, or any ſuch thing, in the middle of which there muſt be a Hole,
whoſe Breadth muſt have the ſame proportion to the length of the Tube, as the Chord
of 6 Minutes bears to the Radius; that is, about as one is to 570. Let the Tube be
turned ſo to the Sun, that no Light may fall upon a white Paper placed at the End
of it, but what comes through the little Hole at the other end of the Tube. The Rays
that <span class="corr" id="xd31e1437" title="Source: comes">come</span> through this will repreſent the Sun upon the Paper of the ſame Brightneſs that the
Inhabitants of <i>Jupiter</i> ſee it in a clear Day. And if removing the Paper you place your Eye in the ſame Place,
you will ſee the Sun of the ſame Magnitude and <span class="pageNum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>Brightneſs as you would were you in Jupiter.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>And in</i> Saturn.</span> If you make the Hole twice as little in breadth, you will ſee the ſame in <i>Saturn</i>. And altho’ his Light be but the hundredth part of ours, yet you ſee it makes him
ſhine tolerably bright in a dark Night. But in both theſe Planets, if there ever be
any cloudy Days, it muſt be very dark in compariſon of us; yet without doubt the Inhabitants
have no more reaſon to complain of the want of Light, than our Owls and Batts, to
whom the Twilight or the Night itſelf is more agreeable than the Brightneſs of the
Day.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>In</i> Jupiter <i>their days are five Hours</i>.</span> But it’s a little ſtrange, that when <i>Jupiter</i> is ſo much bigger than our Planet, their Days and Nights ſhould be but five of our
Hours. By this we may ſee that Nature has not obſerv’d that proportion that their
Bulk ſeems to require, ſeeing in <i>Mars</i> the Days are very little different from ours. But in the length of their Years, that
is, in the Revolution of the Planets round the Sun, there is an exact proportion to
<span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>their diſtances from the Sun followed. For as the Cubes of their Diſtances, ſo are
the Squares of their Revolutions, as <i>Kepler</i> firſt ſound out. Which proportion the Moons of <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i> keep in their Courſes round thoſe <span class="marginnote"><i>Always of the ſame length.</i></span> Planets. As the Years and Days in <i>Jupiter</i> are different from ours in this reſpect, ſo are the Days in another; namely, that
they are all of the ſame length. For they there enjoy a perpetual Equinox, their Axis
having little or no inclination to their Orbit, as the Earth’s has, as has been diſcovered
by Teleſcopes. The Countries that lie near their Poles have little or no Heat, by
reaſon the Rays of the Sun fall ſo obliquely upon them; but then they are freed from
the Inconveniency that ours are troubled with, of tedious long half-year Nights, and
have the conſtant returns of Day and Night every five Hours. Indeed ſuch ſhort Days
would not be agreeable to us, but we think our ſelves much better done by, that ours
are more than twice as long, tho’ upon no other account, but that whatever is our
own, we are apt to imagine, muſt be beſt.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p>The reſt of the Planets are ſo near the Sun (<i>Mars</i> himſelf never being above 18 degrees from it) that in <i>Jupiter</i> they have the ſight only of <i>Saturn</i>. But we cannot deny but that their four Moons ſtand them in greater ſtead than our
one doth us, if ’twere only that they ſeldom know any ſuch Thing as to be without
Moonſhiny Nights. And they are of great Advantage to them, as we ſaid before, in their
Navigation, if they have any ſuch thing. Not to mention the pleaſant Sights of their
frequent Conjunctions and Eclipſes, Things that they are ſeldom a Day without.
</p>
<p><i>Saturn</i> enjoys all thoſe Pleaſures and Advantages in a ſtill higher Degree, as well for his
five Moons, as for the delightful Proſpect that the Ring about him affords his Inhabitants
Night and Day. But we will give an account of their Aſtronomy, as we have done of
the reſt of the Planets.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>They ſee the fix’d Stars juſt as we do.</i></span> And firſt of all we ſhall obſerve what we might have remark’d before, but which will
be more ſtrange here, that the fix’d Stars appear to them of <span class="pageNum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span>the ſame Figure and Magnitude, and with the ſame degree of Light that they do to us:
and this, by reaſon of their immenſe diſtance, of which we ſhall have occaſion to
ſpeak by and by. In compariſon with which the Space that a Bullet-ſhot out of a Cannon
could travel in 25 Years, would be almoſt nothing.
</p>
<p>Their Aſtronomers have all the ſame Signs of the Bear, the Lion, Orion, and the reſt,
but not turning upon the ſame Axis with us: for that’s different in all the Planets.
</p>
<p>As <i>Jupiter</i> can ſee no Planet but <i>Saturn</i>, ſo <i>Saturn</i> knows of no Planet but <i>Jupiter</i>; which appears to him much as <i>Venus</i> doth to us, never removing above 37 Degrees from the Sun. The Length of their Days
I cannot determine: But if from the Diſtance and Period of his innermoſt Attendant,
and comparing it with the innermoſt of <i>Jupiter</i>’s, a Man may venture to give a Gueſs, they are very little different from <i>Jupiter</i>’s, 10 Hours or ſomewhat leſs. But whereas in <i>Jupiter</i> theſe are equally divided between <span class="pageNum" id="pb124">[<a href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>Light and Darkneſs, the Inhabitants of <i>Saturn</i> muſt perceive a more ſenſible difference than we, eſpecially between Summer and Winter.
For our Axis inclines to the Plane of the Ecliptick but 23 degrees and a half<span class="corr" id="xd31e1519" title="Not in source">,</span> but there’s above 31. Upon this Account his Moons muſt decline very much from the
Path that the Sun ſeems to move in, and his Inhabitants can never have a full Moon
but juſt at the Equinoxes; Two of which fall out in 30 of our Years. ’Tis this Poſition
of the Axis too that is the Cauſe of thoſe delightful Appearances, and wonderful Proſpects
that its Inhabitants enjoy: For the better underſtanding of which I ſhall draw a Figure
of <i>Saturn</i> with his Ring about him: in which the Proportion between the Diameters of the Globe
and Ring is as 9 to 4. And the empty Space between them is of the ſame Breadth with
the Ring itſelf. All Obſervations conſpire to prove that That is of no great Thickneſs,
altho’ if we ſhould allow it ſix hundred <i>German</i> Miles, I think, conſidering its Diameter, we ſhould not overdo the Matter.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure fig4width"><img src="images/fig4.png" alt="Fig. 4." width="720" height="383"><p class="figureHead"><i>Fig. 4.</i></p>

</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>Suppoſe then, agreeable to what has been ſaid, the Globe of <i>Saturn</i>, <span class="marginnote"><i>Fig. 4.</i></span> whoſe Poles are A, B. G N is the Diameter of the Ring, as you view it ſideways, repreſenting
a narrow Oval. Thoſe that live about the Poles within the Arches C A D, E B F, each
of which are 54 Degrees, (if the Cold will ſuffer any Body to live there) never have
a Sight of the Ring. <span class="marginnote"><i>The Appearances of the Ring in</i> Saturn.</span> From all other parts it is continually to be ſeen for fourteen Years and nine Months,
which is juſt half their Year. The other Half it is hid from their View. Thoſe then
that dwell between the Polar Circle C D, and the Equator T V, all that time that the
Sun enlightens the Part oppoſite to them, have every Night the Sight of a Piece of
it H G L, much in the Shape of a ſhining Bow, which comes from the Horizon, but is
darken’d in the Middle by the Shadow of <i>Saturn</i> G H, which reaches moſt commonly to the outermoſt Rim of it. But after Midnight that
Shadow by little and little begins to move towards the right Hand to thoſe in the
Northern, but the Left <span class="pageNum" id="pb126">[<a href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>to thoſe in the Southern Hemiſphere. In the Morning it diſappears, leaving behind
it a Likeneſs indeed of a Bow, but much paler and weaker than our Moon is in the Day
time. For they, as I ſaid before, have an Atmoſphere, or an Air ſurrounding them enlightened
by the Sun. Otherwiſe Night and Day they would have their Ring, their Moons, and all
the fix’d Stars, equally conſpicuous. Another thing that muſt make the Sight of their
Ring very curious, is, that by ſome Spots in it, it is diſcover’d to turn round upon
it ſelf: A thing that thoſe that are ſo near cannot but take notice of, when we that
live at this Diſtance can deſcry a great Inequality, the inſide of it being brighter
much than the outſide is. When the Shadow of the Globe falls upon that part of the
Ring G H, the Shadow of the Ring at the ſame time darkens another Part of the Globe
about P F, which otherwiſe would have the Sun upon it. So that there is always a Zone
of the Globe P Y F E, ſometimes of a larger extent than at others, which is depriv’d
of the Sight <span class="pageNum" id="pb127">[<a href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>both of the Sun and Ring for a conſiderable time, the latter of which hides ſome part
of the Stars from it too. And certainly an amazing Thing it muſt be, all of a ſudden
to have the Sun intercepted and to become as dark as <span class="corr" id="xd31e1554" title="Source: Midnidght">Midnight</span>, without ſeeing any Cauſe of ſuch an Accident. All which time their Moons are their
only Comfort. The other half of the Year the Hemiſphere T B V enjoys the ſame Light
that T A U before did, and then this undergoes thoſe long Eclipſes that That before
ſuffer’d. At the Equinoxes, when the Sun is in the ſame Plane with the Ring, the Inhabitants
of <i>Saturn</i> cannot well perceive it: no not even we with our Glaſſes, by reaſon of its Darkneſs.
This happens when <i>Saturn</i>, view’d from the Sun, is advanced one and twenty degrees and a half in <i>Virgo</i> or <i>Piſces</i>, as I have ſhow’d formerly in my Syſtem of <i>Saturn</i>: Where there is an Account given of the Riſings of the Sun above the Ring, throughout
all the Saturnian Year.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb128">[<a href="#pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p>With <i>Saturn</i> in this Scheme you have the Globes of the Earth and Moon drawn in their true proportion,
to put you in mind again of a Thing worth <span class="sic" title="Correction: remembering">remembring</span>, <i>viz.</i> how very ſmall our Habitation is when compar’d with that Globe or the Ring about
it. And now any one, I ſuppoſe, can frame to himſelf a Picture of the Night in <i>Saturn</i>, with two Arches of the Ring, and five Moons ſhining about, and adorning him. This
then is what I had to ſay to the primary Planets.
</p>
<p>We are now come a little lower, to make an enquiry into the Attendants of theſe Planets,
eſpecially our own. And here we ſhall not only conſider their Aſtronomy, but ſhall
alſo ſearch into their Furniture and Ornament, if they are found to have any ſuch
thing, which we have deferred conſidering till now.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Very little to be ſaid of the Moon.</i></span> And here one would think that when the Moon is ſo near us, and by the Means of a
Teleſcope may be ſo nicely and exactly obſerv’d, it ſhould afford us Matter for more
probable <span class="pageNum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>Conjectures than any of the other remote Planets. But it is quite otherwiſe, and I
can ſcarce find any thing to ſay of it, becauſe I have not a Planet of the ſame Nature
before my Eyes, as in all the primary ones I have. For they are of the ſame kind with
our Earth; and ſeeing all the Actions, and every thing that is here, we may make a
reaſonable Conjecture at what we cannot ſee in thoſe Worlds.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Guards of</i> Jupiter <i>and</i> Saturn <i>of the ſame nature with our Moon</i>.</span> But this we may venture to ſay, without fear, that all the Attendants of <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i> are of the ſame Nature with our Moon, as going round them, and being carried with
them round the Sun juſt as the Moon is with the Earth. Their Likeneſs reaches to other
Things too, as you’ll ſee by and by. Therefore whatſoever we can with reaſon affirm
or conjecture of our Moon (and we may ſay a little of it) muſt be ſuppos’d with very
little Alteration to belong to the Satellites of <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i>, as having no reaſon to be at all inferior to that.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Moon hath Mountains.</i></span> The Surface of the Moon then is found, by the leaſt Teleſcopes of about <span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span>three or four Foot, to be diverſified with long Tracts of Mountains, and again with
broad Valleys. For in thoſe Parts oppoſite to the Sun you may ſee the Shadows of the
Mountains, and often diſcover the little round Valleys between them, with a Hillock
or two perhaps riſing out of them. <i>Kepler</i> from the exact roundneſs of them would prove that they are ſome vaſt work of the
rational Inhabitants. But I can’t be of his mind, both for their incredible Largeneſs,
and that they might eaſily be occaſioned by natural Cauſes. Nor can I find any thing
like Sea there, tho’ he and many others are of the contrary Opinion I know. For thoſe
vaſt Countries which appear darker than the other, commonly taken for and called by
the Names of Seas, are diſcover’d with a good long Teleſcope, to be full of little
round Cavities; whoſe Shadow falling within themſelves, makes them appear of that
Colour: and thoſe large Champains there in the Moon you will find not to be always
even and ſmooth, if you look carefully <span class="pageNum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>upon them: neither of which two <span class="marginnote"><i>But no Sea.</i></span> Things can agree to the Sea. Therefore thoſe Plains in her that ſeem brighter than
the other Parts, muſt conſiſt, I ſuppoſe, of a whiter ſort of Matter than they. Nor
do I believe <span class="marginnote"><i>Nor Rivers.</i></span> that there are any Rivers, for if there were, they could never eſcape our Sight,
eſpecially if they run between the Hills as ours do. Nor have they <span class="marginnote"><i>Nor Clouds.</i></span> any Clouds to furniſh the Rivers with Water: For if they had, we ſhould ſometimes
ſee one part of the Moon darkened by them, and ſometimes another, whereas we have
always the ſame Proſpect of her.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Nor Air, and Water.</i></span> ’Tis certain moreover, that the Moon has no Air or Atmoſphere ſurrounding it as we
have. For then we could never ſee the very outermoſt Rim of the Moon ſo exactly as
we do, when any Star goes under it, but its Light would terminate in a gradual faint
Shade, and there would be a ſort of a Down as it were about it; not to mention that
the Vapours of our Atmoſphere conſiſt of Water, and conſequently that where there
are no Seas <span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>or Rivers, there can be no Atmoſphere. This is that notable difference between the
Moon and us that hinders all probable Conjectures about it. If we could but once be
ſure that there were Seas and Rivers in it, it would be no weak Argument to prove
that it has alſo all other Furniture which belongs to our Earth, and the Opinion of
<i>Xenophanes</i> might be true, that it has its Inhabitants, Cities, and Mountains. But as ’tis, I
cannot imagine how any Plants or Animals, whole whole nouriſhment comes from liquid
Bodies, can thrive in a dry, waterleſs, parch’d Soil.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The Conjecture of its Plants and Animals very dubious.</i></span> What then, <span class="corr" id="xd31e1636" title="Source: Is">is</span> it credible that this great Ball was made for nothing but to give us a little Light
in the Night-time, or to raiſe our Tides in the Sea? May there not be ſome People
there that may have the Pleaſure of ſeeing our Earth turn upon itſelf, preſenting
them ſometimes with a Proſpect of <i>Europe</i> and <i>Africa</i>, and then of <i>Aſia</i> and <i>America</i>; ſometimes half of it bright, and ſometimes full? And muſt all thoſe Moons round
<i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>be condemned to the ſame <span class="sic" title="Correction: Uſeleſſneſs">Uſeleſneſs</span>? I do not know what to ſay concerning it, becauſe I know of nothing like them to
found a Conjecture upon. And yet ’tis not improbable that thoſe great and noble Bodies
have ſomewhat or other growing and living upon them, though very different from what
we ſee and enjoy here. Perhaps their Plants and Animals may have another ſort of Nouriſhment
there. Perhaps the Moiſture of the Earth there is but juſt ſufficient to cauſe a Miſt
or Dew, which may be very ſuitable to the Growth of their Herbs. This I remember is
<i>Plutarch</i>’s Opinion, in his Dialogue upon this Subject. For in our Earth a very little Water
drawn from the Sea into Dew, and falling down again upon the Herbs, would be ſufficient
for all our Needs, without any Rain or Showers. But theſe are mere Gueſſes, or rather
Doubts, but yet they are the <span class="marginnote">Jupiter<i>’s and</i> Saturn<i>’s Moons turn always the ſame Side to them</i>.</span> beſt we can make of this, and all thoſe other Moons: for, as I ſaid before, they
are all of the ſame nature, which is proved likewiſe by this, that as our <span class="pageNum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>Moon can afford us the Sight never but of one Side of her, ſo they turn always the
ſame Face to their primary Planets. It may perhaps ſeem ſtrange, how we ſhould come
to know this; but ’tis no hard matter, after that Obſervation which I juſt now made,
that the outermoſt of <i>Saturn</i>’s Moons can never be ſeen but when ſhe is on the Weſt-ſide of her Planet. The reaſon
of which is plainly this, that one Side of her is darker, and does not reflect the
Light ſo much as the other, which when it is turned towards us, we cannot ſee by reaſon
of its weak Light. This always happening when ’tis Eaſt of him, and never on the other
Side, is a manifeſt proof that ſhe always keeps the ſame Side toward <i>Saturn</i>. Now ſince the outermoſt of <i>Saturn</i>’s and our Moon carry themſelves thus to the Planets round which they move, who can
well doubt it of all the reſt round <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i>? And there’s a very good reaſon for it, namely, that the matter of which thoſe Moons
conſiſt, being heavier, and more ſolid on the Side that is averſe from us, than on
<span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span>that which we have the Sight of, does conſequently fly with a greater force from the
Centre of its Orbit: for otherwiſe, according to the Laws of Motion, it ſhould turn
the ſame Side always, not to its Planets, but to the ſame fix’d Stars.
</p>
<p>This Poſition of the Moons, in reſpect of their Planets, muſt occaſion a great many
very ſurprizing Appearances to their Inhabitants, if they have any, which is very
doubtful, but may for the preſent be ſuppos’d. An enquiry into our Moon may ſerve
for all the reſt. Its Globe is divided into two Parts, in ſuch a manner, that thoſe
who live on one Side never loſe the ſight of us, and thoſe on the other never enjoy
it. Except only ſome few who live on the Confines of each of theſe, who loſe us, and
ſee us again by turns. The Earth to them muſt ſeem <span class="marginnote"><i>The Aſtronomy of the Inhabitants of the Moon.</i></span> much larger than the Moon doth to us, as being in Diameter above four times bigger.
But that which is moſt ſurprizing, is, that Night and Day they ſee it always in the
very ſame part of the Heaven, as if it never moved: ſome of them as if ’twas falling
<span class="pageNum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>upon their Heads: others ſomewhat above the Horizon, and others always in the Horizon,
ſtill turning upon it ſelf, and preſenting them every twenty ſour Hours with a View
of all its Countries, even of thoſe that lie near the Poles (I could wiſh my ſelf
in the Moon only for the ſight of them) yet unknown and undiſcovered by us. They have
it in its monthly Wane and Increaſe, they ſee it half, and horned, and full, by turns,
juſt as we do the Body of the Moon. But the Light that they receive of us is five
times larger than what we receive from them. So that in dark Nights that part that
hath the Advantage of being towards us, receives a very glorious Light from us, tho’
<i>Kepler</i> thought otherwise. Their Days are always of the ſame Length with their Nights; and
the Sun riſing and ſetting to them but once in one of our Months, makes the time both
of their Light and Darkneſs to be equal to 15 of our Days. If their Bodies were of
the ſame Materials with ours, thoſe that have the Sun pretty high in their Horizon,
would be almoſt roaſted <span class="pageNum" id="pb137">[<a href="#pb137">137</a>]</span>in ſuch long Days. For the Sun is not farther from them than he is from us. This will
be the Caſe of thoſe that live upon the Borders of the two Hemiſpheres we mentioned;
but thoſe that live under the Poles of the Moon will be juſt about as hot as our Whale-fiſhers
about <i>Iſland</i> and <i>Nova Zemla</i> are, in the Summer-time: who are in ſo little danger of being roaſted, that in the
middle of their Summer, in their Days of three Months length, they very often find
it extreme Cold. I call thoſe the Poles of the Moon, round which the fix’d Stars ſeem
to turn to its Inhabitants, which are different from ours, and alſo from thoſe of
the Ecliptick, although they move round theſe latter, at the diſtance of five Degrees,
in a period of nineteen Years. Their Year they count by the Motion of the Stars, and
their return to the Sun, and ’tis the ſame with ours. They can eaſily do it, becauſe
they have the Stars Day and Night, notwithſtanding the Light of the Sun: for they
have no Atmoſphere (which is the only reaſon that we don’t every <span class="pageNum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>Day enjoy the ſame Sight) to hinder their Obſervations. Nor have they any Clouds to
obſtruct their View, ſo that it is eaſier for them to find out the Courſes of the
Planets, but more difficult to make a true Syſtem of them. For they will be apt to
lay a wrong Foundation, by ſuppoſing that their Earth ſtands ſtill, which will lead
them into more dangerous Errors than <span class="marginnote"><i>This may be applied to the Moons about</i> Jupiter <i>and</i> Saturn.</span> ever it did us. All that I have ſaid belongs as well to <i>Jupiter</i>’s and <i>Saturn</i>’s Satellites as to our Moon, in reſpect of the Planets they move round. The Length
of their Day and Night is always equal to the Time of their Revolution: For example,
the fifth Moon moves round <i>Saturn</i> in 80 Days, and the Days and Nights there are equal to Forty of ours. Both their
Summer and Winter (<i>Saturn</i> moving round the Sun in thirty Years) are fifteen Years long. Therefore it is impoſſible
but that their way of living muſt be very different from ours, having ſuch tedious
Winters, and ſuch long watching and ſleeping times.

<p>Having thus explained the primary and ſecondary Planets round the Sun, we ſhould next
ſet about the third Sort, the Sun and fix’d Stars; but before we do that, it would
be worth while to ſet before you at once, in a clearer and more plain Method than
hitherto, the Magnificence and Fabrick of the Solar Syſtem. Which we can’t poſſibly
do in ſo ſmall a Space as one of our Leaves will but admit of, becauſe the Bodies
of the Planets are ſo prodigiouſly ſmall in companion of their Orbs. But what is wanting
in Figure ſhall be made up in Words. Going back then to the firſt Scheme, ſuppoſe
another <span class="marginnote"><i>Fig. 1.</i></span> like it, and proportionable, drawn upon a very large ſmooth Plain; whoſe outermoſt
Circle repreſenting the Orb of <i>Saturn</i>, muſt be conceived three hundred and ſixty Foot in Semidiameter. In which you muſt
place the Globe and Ring of <i>Saturn</i> of that <span class="marginnote"><i>Fig. 2.</i></span> Bigneſs as the 2d Figure ſhows you. Let all the other Planets be ſuppoſed every one
in his own Orbit, and in the middle of all the Sun, of the ſame Bigneſs that That
Figure repreſents, <span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>namely, about four Inches in Diameter. And then the Orbit or Circle in which the Earth
moves, which the Aſtronomers call the <i>Magnus Orbis</i>, muſt have about ſix and thirty Foot in Semidiameter. In which the Earth muſt be
conceived moving, not bigger than a grain of Millet, and her Companion the Moon ſcarcely
perceivable, moving round her in a Circle a little more than two Inches Diameter,
as in <span class="marginnote"><i>Fig. 5.</i></span> the Figure here adjoined, where the Line A B repreſents a ſmall portion of that Circle
which the Earth moves in: the ſmall Circle therein C is the Earth, and the Circle
D E the Path of the Moon round it, in which the Body of the Moon is D.
</p>
<p>The outermoſt of <i>Saturn</i>’s Moons moves in an Orbit whoſe Semidiameter is 29 Inches; that of <i>Jupiter</i> in a ſomewhat ſmaller, whoſe Semidiameter is 19 and a quarter.
</p>
<p>And thus we have a true and exact Deſcription of the Sun’s Palace, where the Earth
will be Twelve thouſand of its Semidiameters diſtant from him, which in <i>German</i> Miles makes above <span class="pageNum" id="pb141">[<a href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>ſeventeen Millions. But perhaps we may have a clearer Comprehenſion of this vaſt Length,
by comparing it with ſome very ſwift Motion after the Example of <i>Heſiod</i> the Poet, who imagin’d that an Anvil let fall from the Top of Heaven, reach’d the
Earth the tenth Day of its Journey, and in ten more arriv’d at the Bottom of Hell,
the end of it: ſo making the Earth the mid-way between Heaven and Hell. I ſhan’t make
uſe of the Anvil, but of ſomething as good, namely, a Bullet ſhot out of a great Gun,
which may travel perhaps in a Moment, or Pulſe of an Artery, about a hundred Fathom,
as is proved by thoſe Experiments that <i>Merſennus</i> in a Treatiſe of his relates; by which the Sound was found to extend itſelf eighty
hundredth parts in the <span class="marginnote"><i>The immenſe diſtance between the Sun and Planets illuſtrated.</i></span> ſame time. I ſay then, that ſuppoſing a Bullet to move with this Swiftneſs from the
Earth to the Sun, it would ſpend 25 Years in its Paſſage. To make a Journey from <i>Jupiter</i> to the Sun, would require 125, and from <i>Saturn</i> thither 250 Years. This account depends upon the meaſure of the Earth’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>Diameter, which, according to the accurate Obſervations of the <i>French</i>, is 6538594 times ſix <i>Paris</i> Feet, one Degree being 57060 of that Meaſure. This ſhows us how vaſt thoſe Orbs muſt
be, and how inconſiderable this Earth, the Theatre upon which all our mighty Deſigns,
all our Navigations, and all our Wars are tranſacted, is when compared to them. A
very fit Conſideration, and Matter of Reflection, for thoſe Kings and Princes who
ſacrifice the Lives of ſo many People, only to flatter their Ambition in being Maſters
of ſome pitiful Corner of this ſmall Spot. But to return to the matter in hand, now
we have given you an account of the Sun’s proportion to thoſe Orbs and Bodies, we’ll
ſee what more we can ſay of him.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>No ground for Conjecture in the Sun.</i></span> And ſome have thought it not improbable but that the Sun himſelf has alſo his Inhabitants.
But upon what reaſon I cannot imagine, there being leſs ground for a Probability in
him than in the Moon. For we are not yet ſure, whether he be a ſolid or liquid Globe;
altho’, if my Notion of Light <span class="pageNum" id="pb143">[<a href="#pb143">143</a>]</span>be true, upon that account I ſhould rather think him liquid: which his Roundneſs and
equal diſtribution of his Light to all parts are an Argument for. For that very ſmall
inequality on his Surface, which is diſcovered by the Teleſcopes, (and that not always
neither) which makes Men fancy they ſee boiling Seas and belching Mountains of Fire,
is nothing but the trembling Motion of the Vapours our Atmoſphere is full of near
the Earth; which is likewiſe <span class="marginnote"><i>The</i> Faculæ <i>in the Sun not eaſily ſeen</i>.</span> the Cauſe of the Stars twinkling. Nor could I ever have the Luck to diſcern thoſe
bright Spots in the Sun which they boaſt as much of as they do of his dark ones, which
latter I have very often ſeen; ſo that I have very good Reaſon to doubt whether there
be any thing in the Sun brighter than the Sun itſelf. For by the moſt exact Obſervations,
I could never find any ſuch pretended to be ſeen any where but juſt about his dark
Spots; and it is no great wonder that thoſe Parts which are ſo near the darker, ſhould
appear ſomewhat <span class="marginnote"><i>By reaſon of its Heat no Inhabitants like ours can live in the Sun.</i></span> brighter than the reſt. That the Sun is extremely hot and fiery, is beyond <span class="pageNum" id="pb144a">[<a href="#pb144a">144</a>]</span>all diſpute, and ſuch Bodies as ours could not live one Moment in ſuch a Furnace.
We muſt ſuppoſe a new ſort of Animals then, ſuch as we have no Idea or Likeneſs of
among us, ſuch as we can neither imagine nor conceive: which is as much as to ſay,
that we can make no Suppoſition at all about them. No doubt that glorious and vaſt
Body was made for ſome noble End and Uſe, and fram’d with excellent Deſign. And I
think we all very well know and feel its Uſefulneſs in that effuſion of Light and
Heat to all the Planets round it; in the Preſervation and Happineſs of all living
Creatures, and that not only in our Ball, but in thoſe vaſt Globes of <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Saturn</i>, not contemptible when compared with its own. Theſe are ſuch great, ſuch wiſe Ends,
that it is not ſtrange that the Sun ſhould have been made, if it had been only upon
their account. For, as for <i>Kepler</i>’s Fancy, that he hath another Office, namely, to help on the Motion of the Planets
in their own Orbs, by turning about his own Axis (which he would fain eſtabliſh in
his Epitome of the <i>Copernican</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb145">[<a href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>Syſtem) I ſhall give good Reaſons why I cannot aſſent to it.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>The ſix’d Stars so many Suns.</i></span> Before the Invention of Teleſcopes, it ſeemed to contradict <i>Copernicus</i>’s Opinion, to make the Sun one of the fix’d Stars. For the Stars of the firſt Magnitude
being eſteem’d to be about three Minutes Diameter; and <i>Copernicus</i> (obſerving that tho’ the Earth changed its Place, they always kept the ſame diſtance
from us) having ventur’d to ſay that the <i>Magnus Orbis</i> was but a Point in reſpect of the Sphere in which they were placed, it was a plain
Conſequence that every one of them that appeared any thing bright, muſt be larger
than the Path or Orbit of the Earth: which is very abſurd. This is the principal Argument
that <i>Tycho Brahe</i> ſet up againſt <i>Copernicus</i>. But when the Teleſcopes took away thoſe Rays of the Stars which appear when we look
upon them with our naked Eye, (which they do beſt when the Eye-glaſs is black’d with
Smoke) they ſeemed juſt like little ſhining Points, and then that Difficulty vaniſhed,
and the Stars may yet be ſo many Suns. Which is <span class="pageNum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>the more probable, becauſe their Light is certainly their own: for it’s impoſſible
that ever the Sun ſhould ſend, or they reflect it at ſuch a vaſt Diſtance. This is
the Opinion that commonly goes along with <i>Copernicus</i>’s Syſtem. <span class="marginnote"><i>They are not all in the ſame Sphere.</i></span> And the Patrons of it do alſo with reaſon ſuppoſe, that all theſe Stars are not in
the ſame Sphere, as well becauſe there’s no Argument for it, as that the Sun, which
is one of them, cannot be brought to this Rule. But it’s more likely they are ſcatter’d
and diſpers’d all over the immenſe Spaces of the Heaven, and are as far diſtant perhaps
from one another, as the neareſt of them are from the Sun.
</p>
<p>Here again too I know <i>Kepler</i> is of another Opinion in his Epitome of <i>Copernicus</i>’s Syſtem, that we mention’d above. For tho’ he agrees with us, that the Stars are
diffus’d through all the vaſt Expanſe of the Heavens, yet he cannot allow that they
have as large an empty Space about them as our Sun has. For then ’twas his Opinion,
we ſhould ſee but very few, and thoſe of very different Magnitudes: <i>For, ſeeing <span class="pageNum" id="pb147">[<a href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>the largeſt of all appear ſo ſmall to us, that we can ſcarce obſerve or meaſure them
with our beſt Inſtruments; how muſt thoſe appear that are three or four times farther
from us? Why, ſuppoſing them no larger than theſe, they muſt ſeem three or four times
leſs, and ſo on ’till a little farther they will not be to be ſeen at all: Thus we
ſhall have the ſight of but very few Stars, and thoſe very different one from <span class="corr" id="xd31e1838" title="Source: anonother">another</span></i>; Whereas we have above a Thouſand, and thoſe not conſiderably bigger or leſs than
one another. But this by no means proves what he would have it; and his Miſtake was
chiefly, that he did not conſider the Nature of Fire and Flame which may be ſeen at
ſuch diſtances, and at ſuch ſmall Angles as all other Bodies would totally diſappear
under. A thing that we need go no farther than the Lamps ſet along the Streets to
prove. For altho’ they are a hundred Foot from one another, yet you may count Twenty
of them in a continued Row with your Eyes, and yet the twentieth Part of them ſcarce
makes an Angle of ſix Seconds. Certainly <span class="pageNum" id="pb148">[<a href="#pb148">148</a>]</span>then the glorious Light of the Stars muſt do much more than this; ſo that it’s no
wonder we ſhould ſee a Thouſand or two of them with our bare Eyes, and with a Teleſcope
diſcover twenty times that number. But <i>Kepler</i> had a private Deſign in making the Sun thus ſuperiour to all the other Stars, and
planting it in the Middle of the World, attended with the Planets: For his Aim was
hereby to ſtrengthen his Coſmographical Myſtery, that the Diſtances of the Planets
from the Sun are in a certain proportion to the Diameters of the Spheres that are
inſcribed within, and circumſcribed about <i>Euclid</i>’s Regular Bodies. Which could never be ſo much as probable, except there were but
one Chorus of Planets moving round the Sun, and ſo the Sun were the only one of his
kind.
</p>
<p>But that whole Myſtery is nothing but an idle Dream taken from <i>Pythagoras</i> or <i>Plato</i>’s Philoſophy. And the Author himſelf acknowledges that the Proportions do not agree
ſo well as they ſhould, and is fain to invent two <span class="pageNum" id="pb149">[<a href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>or three very ſilly Excuſes for it. And he uſes yet poorer Arguments to prove that
the Univerſe is of a ſpherical Figure, and that the Number of the Stars muſt neceſſarily
be finite, becauſe the Magnitude of each of them is ſo. But what is worſt of all is,
that he ſettles the Space between the Sun and the Concavity of the Sphere of the fix’d
Stars, to be ſix hundred thouſand of the Earth’s Diameters. For this reaſon, which
he has no Foundation for, that as the Diameter of the Sun is to that of the Orbit
of <i>Saturn</i>, which he makes to be as 1 to 2000, ſo is this Diameter to that of the Sphere of
the fixed Stars. I cannot but wonder how ſuch things as theſe could fall from ſo ingenious
a Man, and ſo great an Aſtronomer. But I muſt be of the ſame Opinion with all the
greateſt Philoſophers of our Age, that the Sun is of the ſame Nature with the fix’d
Stars. And this will give us a greater Idea of the World, than all thoſe other Opinions.
<span class="marginnote"><i>The Stars have Planets about them like our Sun.</i></span> For then why may not every one of theſe Stars or Suns have as great a Retinue as
our Sun, of Planets, with their <span class="pageNum" id="pb150">[<a href="#pb150">150</a>]</span>Moons, to wait upon them? Nay, there’s a manifeſt reaſon why they ſhould. For if we
imagine our ſelves placed at an equal diſtance from the Sun and fix’d Stars; we ſhould
then perceive no difference between them. For, as for all the Planets that we now
ſee attend the Sun, we ſhould not have the leaſt glimpſe of them, either becauſe their
Light would be too weak to affect us, or that all the Orbs in which they move would
make up one lucid Point with the Sun. In this Station we ſhould have no occaſion to
imagine any difference between the Stars, and ſhould make no doubt if we had but the
Sight, and knew the Nature of one of them, to make that the Standard of all the reſt.
We are then plac’d near one of them, namely, our Sun, and ſo near as to diſcover ſix
other Globes moving round him, ſome of them having others performing them the ſame
Office. Why then may not we make uſe of the ſame Judgment that we would in that caſe;
and conclude, that our Star has no better attendance than the others? So that <span class="pageNum" id="pb151">[<a href="#pb151">151</a>]</span>what we allowed the Planets, upon the account of our enjoying it, we muſt likewiſe
grant to all thoſe Planets that ſurround that prodigious number of Suns. They muſt
have their Plants and Animals, nay and their rational Creatures too, and thoſe as
great Admirers, and as diligent Obſervers of the Heavens as our ſelves; and muſt conſequently
enjoy whatſoever is ſubſervient to, and requiſite for ſuch Knowledge.
</p>
<p>What a wonderful and amazing Scheme have we here of the magnificent Vaſtneſs of the
Univerſe! So many Suns, ſo many Earths, and every one of them ſtock’d with ſo many
Herbs, Trees, and Animals, and adorn’d with ſo many Seas and Mountains! And how muſt
our Wonder and Admiration be <span class="corr" id="xd31e1868" title="Source: encreaſed">increaſed</span> when we conſider the prodigious Diſtance and Multitude of the Stars?
</p>
<p>That their Diſtance is ſo immenſe, that the Space between the Earth and Sun (which
is no leſs than Twelve thouſand of the Earth’s Diameters) is almoſt nothing when compar’d
to it, has more Proofs than one to confirm <span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span>it. And this among the reſt. If you obſerve two Stars near one another, as for example
thoſe in the middle of the Great Bears Tail, differing very much from one another
in Clearneſs, notwithſtanding our changing our Poſition in our Annual Orbit round
the Sun, and that there would be a Parallax were the Star which is brighter nearer
to us than the other, as is very probable it is, yet whatever Part of the Year you
look upon them, they will not in the leaſt have altered their diſtance. Thoſe that
have hitherto undertook to calculate their Diſtance, have not been able perfectly
to compaſs their Deſign, by reaſon of the extreme Niceneſs and almoſt Impoſſibility
of the Obſervations requiſite for their Purpoſe. The only Method that I ſee remaining,
to come at any tolerable Probability in ſo difficult a Caſe, I ſhall here make uſe
of. Seeing then that the Stars, as I ſaid before, are ſo many Suns, if we do but ſuppoſe
one of them equal to ours, it will follow that its diſtance from us is as much greater
than that of the Sun, as its apparent <span class="pageNum" id="pb153">[<a href="#pb153">153</a>]</span>Diameter is leſs than the Diameter of the Sun. But the Stars, even thoſe of the firſt
Magnitude, though view’d through a Teleſcope, are ſo very ſmall, that they ſeem only
like ſo many ſhining Points, without any perceivable Breadth. So that ſuch Obſervations
can here do us no good. When <span class="marginnote"><i>A way of making a probable gueſs at the diſtance of the Stars.</i></span> I ſaw this would not ſucceed, I ſtudied by what way I could ſo leſſen the Diameter
of the Sun, as to make it not appear larger than the Dog, or any other of the chief
Stars. To this purpoſe I clos’d one End of my twelve-foot Tube with a very thin Plate,
in the Middle of which I made a Hole not exceeding the twelfth Part of a Line, that
is the hundred and forty fourth Part of an Inch. That End I turn’d to the Sun, placing
my Eye at the other, and I could ſee ſo much of the Sun as was in Diameter about the
182d part of the Whole. But ſtill that little piece of him was brighter much than
the Dog-ſtar is in the cleareſt Night. I ſaw that this would not do, but that muſt
leſſen the Diameter of the Sun a great deal more. I made <span class="pageNum" id="pb154">[<a href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>then ſuch another Hole in a Plate, and againſt it I plac’d a little round Glaſs that
I had made uſe of in my Microſcopes, of much about the ſame Diameter with the former
Hole. Then looking again towards the Sun (taking care that no Light might come near
my Eye to hinder my Obſervation) I found it appeared of much the ſame Clearneſs with
<i>Sirius</i>. But caſting up my account, according to the Rules of <i>Dioptricks</i>, I found his Diameter now was but 1⁄152 part of that hundred and eighty ſecond part
of his whole Diameter that I ſaw through the former Hole. Multiplying 1⁄152 and 1⁄182
into one another, the Product I found to be 1⁄27664​. The Sun therefore being contracted
into ſuch a Compaſs, or being removed ſo far from us (for it’s the ſame thing) as
to make his Diameter but the 27664 part of that we every Day ſee, will ſend us juſt
the ſame Light as the Dog-ſtar now doth. And his diſtance then from us will be to
his preſent diſtance undoubtedly as 27664 is to 1; and his Diameter little above four
Thirds, 4‴. Seeing <span class="pageNum" id="pb155">[<a href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>then <i>Sirius</i> is ſuppoſed equal to the Sun, it follows that his Diameter is likewiſe 4‴, and that
his Diſtance to the Diſtance of the Sun from us is as 27664 to 1. And what an incredible
Diſtance that is, will appear by the ſame way of reaſoning that we uſed in meaſuring
that of the Sun. For if 25 Years are required for a Bullet out of a Cannon, with its
utmoſt Swiftneſs, to travel from the Sun to us; then by multiplying the Number 27664
into 25, we ſhall find that ſuch a Bullet would ſpend almoſt ſeven hundred thouſand
Years in its Journey between us and the neareſt of the fix’d Stars. And yet when in
a clear Night we look upon them, we cannot think them above ſome few Miles over our
Heads. What I have here enquir’d into, is concerning the neareſt of them. And what
a prodigious Number muſt there be beſides of thoſe which are placed in the vaſt Spaces
of Heaven, as to be as remote from theſe as theſe are from the Sun! For if with our
bare Eyes we can obſerve above a Thouſand, and with a Teleſcope can <span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>diſcover ten or twenty times as many; what bounds of Number can we ſet to thoſe which
are out of the Reach even of theſe Aſſiſtances! eſpecially if we conſider the infinite
Power of God. Really, when I have been reflecting thus with my ſelf, me-thoughts all
our Arithmetick was nothing, and we are vers’d but in the very Rudiments of Numbers,
in compariſon of this great Sum. For this requires an immenſe Treaſury, not of twenty
or thirty Figures only, in our decuple Progreſſion, but of as many as there are Grains
of Sand upon the Shore. And yet who can ſay, that even this Number exceeds that of
the Fix’d Stars? Some of the Ancients, and <i>Jordanus Brunus</i> carry’d it further, in declaring the Number infinite: he would perſwade us that he
has prov’d it by many Arguments, tho’ in my opinion they are none of them concluſive.
Not that I think the contrary can ever be made out. Indeed it ſeems to me certain,
that the Univerſe is infinitely extended; but what God has been pleas’d to place beyond
the Region of <span class="pageNum" id="pb157">[<a href="#pb157">157</a>]</span>the Stars, is as much above our Knowledge, as it is beyond our Habitation.
</p>
<p>Or what if beyond ſuch a determinate Space he has left an infinite Vacuum; to ſhow,
how inconſiderable all that he has made is, to what his Power could, had he ſo pleas’d,
have produced? But I am falling, before I am aware, into that intricate Diſpute of
Infinity: Therefore I ſhall wave this, and not, as ſoon as I am free of one, take
upon me another difficult Task. All that I ſhall do more is to add ſomewhat of my
Opinion concerning the whole World, as it is a Place for the Reception of the Suns
or fix’d Stars, every one of which, I have ſhowed, may have their Planetary Syſtems
about them.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Every Sun has a Vortex round it, very different from thoſe of</i> Cartes.</span> I am of Opinion then that every Sun is ſurrounded with a Whirl-pool or Vortex of
Matter in a very ſwift Motion; tho’ not in the leaſt like <i>Cartes</i>’s either in their Bulk, or manner of Motion. For <i>Cartes</i> makes his ſo large, as every one of them to touch all the others round them, in a
flat Surface, juſt as you have ſeen the Bladders that <span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span>Boys blow up in Soap-ſuds do; and would have the whole Vortex to move round the ſame
way. But the Angles of every Vortex will be no ſmall hindrance to ſuch a Motion. Then
the whole Matter moving round at once, upon the Axis as it were of a Cylinder, did
not a little puzzle him in giving Reaſons for the Roundneſs of the Sun: which however
they may ſatisfy ſome People that do not conſider them, really prove nothing of the
Matter. In this æthereal Matter the Planets float, and are carried round by its Motion:
and the thing that keeps them in their own Orbs is, that they themſelves, and the
Matter in which they ſwim, equally ſtrive to fly off from the Center of this Motion.
Againſt all which there are many Aſtronomical Objections, ſome of which I touch’d
upon in my Eſſay of the Cauſes of Gravity. Where I gave another Account of the Planets
not deſerting their own Orbs; which is their Gravitation towards the Sun. I ſhow’d
there the Cauſes of that Gravitation, and cannot but wonder that <span class="pageNum" id="pb159">[<a href="#pb159">159</a>]</span><i>Cartes</i>, the firſt Man that ever began to talk reaſonably of that Matter, ſhould never meddle
with, or light on it. <i>Plutarch</i> in his Book of the Moon above-mentioned ſays, that ſome of the Ancients were of Opinion,
that the Reaſon of the Moon’s keeping her Orbit was, that the Force of her Circular
Motion was exactly equal to her Gravity, the one of which pull’d her to, as much as
the other forc’d off from the Centre. And in our Age <i>Alphonſus Borellus</i>, who was of this ſame Opinion in the other Planets as well as the Moon, makes the
Gravitation of the primary Planets to be towards the Sun, as that of the Secondary
is towards the Planets round which they move: Which Sir <i>Iſaac Newton</i> has more fully explain’d, with a great deal of Pains and Subtilty; and how from that
Cauſe proceeds the Ellipticity of the Orbs of the Planets, found out by <i>Kepler</i>. According to my Notion of the Gravitation of the Planets to the Sun, the Matter
of his Vortex muſt not at all move the ſame <span class="pageNum" id="pb160">[<a href="#pb160">160</a>]</span>way, but after ſuch a manner as to have its Parts carry’d different ways on all Sides.
And yet there is no fear of its being deſtroyed by ſuch an irregular Motion, becauſe
the Æther round it, which is at reſt, keeps the Parts of it from flying out. With
the Help of ſuch a Vortex as this I have undertook in that Eſſay to explain the Gravity
of Bodies on this Earth, and all the Effects of it. And I ſuppoſe there may be the
ſame Cauſe as well of the Gravitation of the Planets, and of our Earth among the reſt,
towards the Sun, as of their Roundneſs: A Thing ſo very hard to give an Account of
in <i>Cartes</i>’s Syſtem.
</p>
<p>I muſt differ from him too in the Bigneſs of the Vortices, for I cannot allow them
to be ſo large as he would make them. I would have them diſperſed all about the immenſe
Space, like ſo many little Whirl-pools of Water, that one makes by the ſtirring of
a Stick in any large Pond or River, a great way diſtant from one another. And as their
Motions do not all intermix <span class="pageNum" id="pb161">[<a href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>or communicate with one another, ſo in my Opinion muſt the Vortices of Stars be placed
as not to hinder one <span class="sic" title="Correction: another’s">anothers</span> free Circumrotations.
</p>
<p>So that we may be ſecure, and never fear that they will ſwallow up or deſtroy one
another; for that was a mere Fancy of <i>Cartes</i>’s, when he was a ſhowing how a fix’d Star or Sun might be turn’d into a Planet. And
’tis plain that when he writ it, he had no Thoughts of the immenſe Diſtance of the
Stars from one another; particularly, by this one Thing, that he would have a Comet
as ſoon as ever it comes into our Vortex, to be ſeen by us. Which is as abſurd as
can be. For how could a Star, which gives us ſuch a vaſt Light only from the Reflection
of the Beams of the Sun, as he himſelf owns they do; how I ſay could that be ſo plainly
ſeen at a diſtance Ten thouſand times larger than the Diameter of the Earth’s Orbit?
He could not but know that all round the Sun there is a vaſt <i>Extenſum</i>; ſo vaſt, that in <i>Copernicus</i>’s Syſtem the <span class="pageNum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span><i>magnus Orbis</i> is counted but a Point in compariſon with it. But indeed all the whole Story of Comets
and Planets, and the Production of the World, is founded upon ſuch poor and trifling
Grounds, that I have often wonder’d how an ingenious Man could ſpend all that pains
in making ſuch Fancies hang together. For my part, I ſhall be very well contented,
and ſhall count I have done a great Matter, if I can but come to any Knowledge of
the Nature of Things, as they now are, never troubling my ſelf about their Beginning,
or how they were made, knowing that to be out of the reach of human Knowledge, or
even Conjecture.

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
